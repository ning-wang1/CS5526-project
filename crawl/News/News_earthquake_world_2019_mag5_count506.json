The National Alliance\u2013led government under Sir Michael Somare completed almost two full terms. This was due in part to the Mekere Morauta government\u2013instituted legal changes that limited movements of members of parliament between parties. These provisions were since deemed unconstitutional.\n\nThe O\u2019Neill\u2013led governments of 2011/12 and 2012\u201317 have been sustained under the relatively original provisions of the constitution, and been the first to survive a full term of parliament with the full freedom of movement of members of parliament.\n\nDemocracy is a prerequisite, and some semblance of political stability is a prerequisite also, for holistic development. The experience since independence, in the constant changes through motions of no confidence, made it extremely difficult for any sort of constructive governance.\n\nIt would be naive to conclude that the PNG party system has reached political maturity, although it is improving. Much of the credit goes to the political leadership of Prime Minister O\u2019Neill.\n\nPolitical stability is important, but not at the cost of political entrenchment, of course. The mechanism of motions of no confidence are fine, but the various hurdles, such as the number of members required to sponsor a motion, must not be so low as to make it potentially frivolous. The weak party system that we still have, in conjunction with an easily activated no-confidence process and short grace periods, can lead to election mandates being usurped and political management being the order of the day rather than constructive governance.\n\nSo political stability under our Prime Minister has enabled us to test our policies in the last six years. We are also able to compare these with the NA\u2013led government which was in power for nine continuous years, or compare them with other governments.\n\nAt the very least, we have had a primary basis for governance, unlike in the past, and we must take best advantage of this to progress reforms and development.\n\nThe NA government, particularly in its second term, enjoyed huge revenue flows from a commodity boom and built up large trust account balances that unfortunately, and despite some good intentions, were rapidly spent without much to show for it.\n\nWhen I came in as planning minister in 2012, the sweep taskforce was investigating much of the abuse that had happened at the Department of Planning, and we had to review the method of pooling and distributing funds from programs, such as the National Agriculture Development Plan, RESI, and Social Development Program.\n\nDespite the wastage, the NA government got debt down and delivered the PNG LNG project. The current low-price environment is revealing some flaws in the project agreement, and of course we did not provide for domestic market obligations or local content obligations; nevertheless, this is a massive achievement which will bear more fruit one day.\n\nThe 25-point plan responds to these project agreement flaws and the general quandary, and why, despite a large current account surplus, we face revenue and foreign exchange shortages. The other obvious question posed is why we continue to support arrangements that send our oil and gas offshore, only to import refined petroleum products back in and look to Forex to pay for it. Imported crude oil and diesel incur the highest Forex bills for a single imported product, followed by rice.\n\nI will just jump sideways now and veer off before coming back to the PNG coalition experience and the economy.\n\nThe fastest way to progress a nation is to enable its people. The primary enabler is a quality education. This is only made more evident in the information and technology revolution we are experiencing today.\n\nI\u2019ve had an opportunity to travel to the United States, Asia, and Israel recently. One thing which continues to strike me as I compare countries is that we have one of the best education systems in the world on our doorstep, in Australia.\n\nOf course, PNG needs to build its own international-standard education system, but as an accelerator to that I really believe we need to integrate our education system more with the Australian system to take better advantage of it. The development assistance from Australia to PNG should have education as its primary focus, and this should comprise, in the shorter term, of providing 500 to 1000 places in Australian boarding schools per year for the highest achievers from Grade 9. There should be a large program placing Australian lecturers in our universities and teachers in our schools, and vice versa. I have written to High Commissioner Bruce Davis on this, and will take it up with my counterpart Treasurer Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop when we meet this week.\n\nThe people-to-people engagement between our countries that we always talk about needs more realisation. Papua New Guineans should have visa-on-arrival status for tourism, short-stay purposes and family visits, in the same manner we grant this status to Australians coming into PNG.\n\nThere should be more Australians in PNG and more PNGs in Australia. We need to accelerate the education of our young people, the quality of English spoken and written expression, and the adoption of the latest technology and systems by greater interaction with the Australian people and education system. This is the help we need while we also build the PNG system.\n\nFour or five hundred Papua New Guineans returning per year from the Australian high school or university system is the fastest way I can think of to create the critical mass of a middle class to feed into leadership, bureaucracy, and business innovation.\n\nAnother significant and related accelerator in terms of global integration and access to knowledge and education is a modern ICT infrastructure network. The new 20-terabyte cable from Sydney to Port Moresby, and the domestic submarine cable and terrestrial fibre-optic network are critical.\n\nAccess to cheap, speedy internet means access to knowledge and education \u2013 it\u2019s a no-brainer. Cheap and accessible electricity and internet at village level is transformative. It\u2019s a part of the 25-point plan, and the procurement of the international cable is underway, again with the help of our Australian friends. Phase 1 of the National Broadband Network is almost complete, with Phase 2 under consideration, and we have signed up for the construction of the domestic submarine cable which will also provide an international gateway to Asia through Jayapura, Indonesia.\n\nEvents such as the 2018 APEC meeting are also about global integration, participation, and knowledge sharing. We need modern capital and technology to develop. It is a bold undertaking by our small country to introduce ourselves to the world, and we are committed to it. We need to take full advantage of it.\n\nThe obvious point I\u2019m making here is the importance of education and an educated population. It is the key because we have all the other elements necessary in the development equation. The standard of our human capital is hindering the speed of the transformation to a modern economy, delivering the minimum socio-economic standards.\n\nI say these things also in terms of the relationship between our two countries, and the need to respond to the dynamic of the rise of the Asia-Pacific and China as a global power.\n\nWe need to be fully aware of this in terms of the opportunities and challenges it represents. The traditional relationships, development assistance, business, and trade are all shifting. Australia and the United States need to step up and respond. The geographical proximity and shared bonds of history between us means we can respond from a people-to-people and relationship basis.\n\nWe want trade and investment. We appreciate concessional financing. But we also hold dear democracy and its principles and institutions. We like free press, freedom of speech, and human rights. Many of these foundations remain fragile, and we need our traditional partners to remain fully engaged in the region and with us.\n\nWhen the O\u2019Neill/Namah and then O\u2019Neill/Dion government took power, we began a deliberate program to create a larger resource envelope and invest heavily into infrastructure, education, health, and law and order. This commenced with the tuition fee\u2013free policy in 2011.\n\nThe government pursued a policy of deliberate deficit budgets to continue fiscal stimulus after the PNG LNG construction phase, and to bridge the gap until production began. There was much excitement and anticipation leading into first gas delivery because it was touted that our revenues would double.\n\nWell, it\u2019s an old story now that oil prices collapsed immediately after production commenced. We then faced the El Ni\u00f1o drought and devastating earthquake and national elections.\n\nThe good news is that there have been significant and visible improvements in our productive capacity through infrastructure, in terms of roads, the major seaports and airports, hospitals and schools. This stimulates the economy and makes services more accessible. Our economy is slowly becoming more diversified, and revenue reliance on the mineral and petroleum sector has greatly reduced.\n\nThe bad news is that against the growth in GDP, particularly related to the PNG LNG project, against which we spent many hundreds of millions for the equity investment and landowners\u2019 commitments, we have not had the corresponding revenue growth whilst the interest burden and cost of the public service has grown.\n\nSo, with these experiences behind us, the O\u2019Neill/Abel government following the 2017 elections instituted the 100-day 25-point plan, commencing with the 2017 supplementary budget, and now the 2018 budget is responding with measures to:\n\n\u2022 increase revenue to 14.6% of GDP and beyond\n\n\u2022 restrict costs to 16% of GDP\n\n\u2022 maintain a debt-to-GDP ratio below 35%, and bring budgets back to balance over time\n\n\u2022 bring on the PNG LNG expansion project, Papua LNG and Wafi-Golpu project under an improved fiscal template (better revenue flows, Forex)\n\n\u2022 progress internal generation of cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable power, and reduce reliance on imported diesel (POM gas, Napa Napa, etc.)\n\n\u2022 progress the local production of rice, stockfeed, dairy, vegetables, eggs and meat, particularly to reduce imports and Forex demand\n\n\u2022 address the Forex shortage and interest costs through central bank intervention, new project acceleration, and debt restructuring to bring in the balance of the Credit Suisse loan, the World Bank budget support, and the ADB health loan and budget support (signed last week)\n\n\u2022 fix the Highlands Highway ($1 billion MTFF ADB)\n\n\u2022 upgrade the international submarine telecommunication cable and build the National Broadband Network\n\n\u2022 complete the Lae and POM seaports and activate the international operator\n\n\u2022 support SMEs\n\n\u2022 meet our commitments to free education, health, and the provincial governments and districts.\n\nIt should not be forgotten how the 2017 supplementary budget took the difficult decision to cut provincial and district grants under the DSIP/PSIP funding by 80%. The 2017 final budget outcome has reported a 31.9% debt-to-GDP ratio and 2.4% fiscal deficit based on our response to maintain the parameters of the 2017 budget and maintain fiscal discipline.\n\nWe need to continue to give due attention to institutional governance, especially around accountability and procurement and corruption. The Prime Minister will be making some announcements shortly on the activation of ICAC. The 25-point plan has elements that address procurement and reporting.\n\nThe sweep of government accounts through the Public Money Management Regularisation Act I introduced with the 2018 budget has not only raised significant revenues that we can use for front-line services, but also reduced our domestic financing costs, as we were previously borrowing this money back through treasury bills from the banks who held these surplus funds.\n\nThe government is also committed to getting a fairer share of returns on our natural resources whilst appreciating the significance of resources, such as our forests, tuna stocks, and biodiversity in a global sense, as explained in the National Strategy for Responsible Sustainable Development (STaRS).\n\nThe Alotau Accord highlights the high population growth rate as a development priority, and new programs in health with the World Bank and the ADB emphasise access to family planning in conjunction with our good friends in the UNDP, and NGO partners.\n\nWith the impact of our 25-point plan interventions coming through, as captured in the 2017 supplementary and 2018 budgets, and the oil price sustaining above US$70 per barrel, the indicators are looking promising. If it were not for the massive earthquake affecting gas, oil, and gold production, at current prices we were certainly looking at outdoing the 2018 budget revenue projections. We will publish a mid-year financial outlook report shortly to see how we are tracking.\n\nWe have had some tough times, and that is exactly why government responded as it did straight after the elections.\n\nI believe the APEC event will cap off a year of recovery for our country in spectacular fashion. APEC should be a culmination of sorts of an effort to bring focus, investment, tourism, and engagement to PNG and the Pacific through events such as the APC parliamentary meetings, the Pacific Games, and FIFA U-20 Women\u2019s World Cup. Apart from the general engagements, specific proposals are being prepared for prospective investments, climate or green funds, grant and concessional funding at APEC.\n\nLadies and gents, I will conclude my remarks here, but as I wrote in STaRS, Papua New Guinea needs to deliberately transition to a new socio-economic paradigm by slowing its population growth rate, accelerating the education of its people to international standard, and \u2013 based on 15% of the world\u2019s tuna, its third-largest rainforest, 8% of the world\u2019s biodiversity, fertile soil and abundant water, and 800 cultures \u2013 build an economy that feeds and energises itself and exports surplus food, power, and climate stability. Mineral and petroleum resources are to be partially converted into a sovereign wealth fund, from which only rents can be extracted, not capital. It should certainly be an aspiration anyway.\n\nLet us all continue to work together for a prosperous and stable region, and for a prosperous and stable Papua New Guinea. Australia and PNG have a very special bond and that will not change.\n\nThanks for having me."}, {"title": "Avoid overtouristed destinations and visit these unsung hotspots instead", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/travel/themes/adventure/111304133/avoid-overtouristed-destinations-and-visit-these-unsung-hotspots-instead", "content": "We've all been there. And wished we hadn't been. Standing elbow to elbow with our fellow travellers, breathing in \"eau de tourist\", seething at selfie-sticks protruding from the sea of heads like periscopes and wishing, for the love of god, that everyone else had just stayed home and left Angkor Wat, the Eiffel Tower or Machu Picchu in peace.\n\nOvertourism is the buzzword of our time, thanks in large part to travel being more affordable and the world being more accessible than ever. And it shows no sign of abating.\n\nLast year international tourist arrivals worldwide reached 1.4 billion, two years ahead of schedule according to the UN World Tourism Organisation. France, the world's most popular country, is expecting a record 100 million visitors a year by 2020; 30 million people will step aboard cruise ships this year; and destinations from Rome to Reykjavik are straining under the weight of too many tourists.\n\nBy putting what's been called an \"invisible burden\" on the places we visit, overtourism is the antithesis of responsible tourism, which aims to make destinations better to live in as well as to visit.\n\n123RF Maya Beach had to close due to overtourism.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Philippines reopened 'paradise' after six-month cleanup\n\n* If disaster strikes on holiday make sure you're ready for the worst\n\n* How travellers can beat crowds and help reduce overtourism\n\nIt's not as simple as avoiding certain places at certain times of the year \u2013 though that's a good start. All over the world, travel companies are working with local, regional and national governments to find solutions, relocating cruise ship berths outside city centres, imposing limits on Airbnb rentals, issuing fines for anti-social behaviour, even creating apps to help tourists avoid each other.\n\nTo cope with the 30 million tourists it receives, Venice installed crowd-control gates last year and will start charging daytrippers up to \u20ac10 a day from May 1 this year. Thailand's Maya Bay on Phi Phi Island near Krabi, made famous by The Beach and Leonardo di Caprio, has closed indefinitely to let its damaged marine environment recover from overtourism. And Bali recently announced plans for a $US10 per person tourist tax to remove rubbish left behind by its 6.5 million visitors a year.\n\nSome operators are urging tourists to take roads less travelled. Intrepid recently launched two \"Not Hot Travel Lists\" to ease the pressure on better-known destinations in Europe and Asia, recommending anti-hotspots such as Cyprus instead of Croatia and Uzbekistan's UNESCO-listed Bukhara instead of Angkor Wat.\n\nSUPPLIED Angkor Wat is frequently on lists of over-tourists spots.\n\nWorld Expeditions has noticed increased demand for its exploratory trips in remote regions such as the Changla Himal in far western Nepal and for alternative trails such as Peru's Salkantay Trek (instead of the Inca Trail) and the Italian Camino (instead of the busy French/Spanish Way).\n\n\"We're finding that more confident travellers are less interested in replicating the travel experiences they may have seen on social media and more interested in seeking out lesser visited destinations and trails,\" says World Expeditions CEO Sue Badyari.\n\nIn January, the World Tourism Organisation itself even took action, launching a new Association for Culture and Heritage (wtach.org) to protect unique cultures and historical sites threatened by overtourism, promote ethical tourism and encourage respect for host communities particularly those thrust into the spotlight by our quest for more \"authentic\" experiences.\n\n\"It's as much about how you travel, as where,\" says Matt Cameron-Smith, managing director of Trafalgar, whose tours often visit big-ticket landmarks such as the Vatican City when they're closed and include regional areas as well as cities to give back to local communities.\n\nWHITE RAIN Dubrovnik has heaved under the pressure of incoming cruise visitors.\n\nCruise ships cop a lot of flak for overwhelming port cities such as Dubrovnik, but \"the vast majority of cruise destinations worldwide don't face serious concerns from tourism\", says Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) managing director Australasia Joel Katz. Having said that, CLIA and individual cruise lines are striving to maximise the economic benefits of cruising to the destinations visited and manage visitation impacts by, for instance, encouraging ground operators to develop new excursions that spread visitors across a broader area, says Katz.\n\nThe good news is that there are still plenty of \"undertouristed\" places. Some have long been bridesmaids to more popular neighbours. Some are recovering from natural disasters or civil wars. Others have just been too remote or unusual to attract visitors until now.\n\nWhatever the reason, the following are 10 unsung destinations likely to benefit from your tourist dollars \u2013 and where you'll be assured of a warm reception.\n\nWelcome to tourism's new guard.\n\nJORDAN\n\n123RF Petra starred in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\n\nWHY THEY WANT YOU Jordan is a small, politically stable country sharing its borders with some serious headline-makers: Syria, Iraq, Israel and the West Bank and Saudi Arabia. Tourism slumped by more than 60 per cent during the Syrian civil war and while it's picking up now, even Petra isn't as busy as it used to be.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO Petra is a must, an otherworldly archaeological park carved from pink sandstone more than 2000 years ago. Other must-see spots are the Mars-like landscape of Wadi Rum, the Roman ruins at Jerash, the salty Dead Sea and the dive resorts of Aqaba. To experience Bedouin culture, stay at the award-winning Feynan Ecolodge. There's also an emerging adventure scene with new long-distance trekking and mountain bike trails that opened in 2017.\n\nWHEN TO GO Anytime, but March-May to avoid the heat and the rains.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY When visiting Petra, stay in Wadi Musa so you can walk to the World Heritage site early or late in the day for the best light and fewer tourists.

More than 5000 people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless, particularly in Kathmandu and the Langtang Valley, north of the capital.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO Guided trekking originated in Nepal in the 1960s, and it's still the best way to see this Himalayan country, giving you the opportunity to slow-travel through incredible landscapes and experience unscripted friendliness from the people who live in them. Consider sidestepping the three busiest trekking regions \u2013 Everest, the Annapurnas and the Langtang Valley \u2013 by trying lesser-known treks around Makalu, Manaslu and Kanchenjunga.\n\nWHEN TO GO Either side of the summertime monsoon, but spring (March-May) tends to be less busy than autumn (September-November) when clear skies ramp up the mountain views. Winter trekking can be magical and blissfully uncrowded, if you can handle a bit of extreme cold, particularly at night.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY Teahouse treks and camping treks both support local communities in different ways, but camping helps reduce deforestation caused by using wood for fuel.\n\nESSENTIALS World Expeditions' new Self-guided Everest Treks offer the experience of walking at your own pace, staying at exclusive eco-camps en route.

It's been promoting \"10 new Balis\" but two of its rising stars, Lombok and Tanjung Lesung off Java, were hit late last year by an earthquake and a tsunami respectively and need visitors to help them get back on their feet.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO Indonesia's \"new Balis\" include Borobudur, the world's largest temple, in central Java; volcanic Mount Bromo in eastern Java; and the Thousand Islands off Jakarta. Then there's Komodo, famed for its ancient tribes as well as its dragons; Sumatra, where you can see wild orangutans; and the limestone islands of Raja Ampat, West Papua, an emerging dive destination with some of the healthiest coral reefs on the planet.\n\nWHEN TO GO If you don't mind an occasional tropical downpour, you'll see fewer tourists November-April than during the May-October high season.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY Plastic pollution recently prompted Bali to ban single-use plastics, but wherever you go BYO reusable water bottle, coffee cup and shopping bags.\n\nESSENTIALS Southern Sea Ventures runs 10-day liveaboard sea kayaking and dive trips in Raja Ampat.

After a terrorist attack in December, SafeTravel (safetravel.govt.nz) advises travellers to \"reconsider your need to travel\" but Egypt is \"no less safe than Paris or London, or Sydney or Melbourne for that matter\", says Dennis Bunnik, who has visited 20 times, most recently in January this year.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO With 5000 years of history on display, Egypt is an Indiana Jones of a destination if ever there was one. There's the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Sphinx, the hieroglyphic-lined Karnak Temple, the Valley of the Kings. Sailing down the Nile on a felucca is a must, as are riding a camel at sunset past the pyramids and haggling at Cairo's Khan Al-Khalili bazaar.\n\nWHEN TO GO October to February, to avoid searing summer temperatures.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY If you visit during Ramadan, May 5 to June 4 this year, dress conservatively and don't eat or drink outdoors between sunrise and sunset.\n\nESSENTIALS Bunnik Tours has several small-group Egypt trips such as the 17-day Egypt in Depth, see bunniktours.com.au\n\nPAPUA NEW GUINEA\n\nWHY THEY WANT YOU PNG is one of the world's most undertouristed destinations, receiving fewer than 200,000 visitors a year thanks to its reputation for crime, corruption and occasional clashes between rival cultural groups. Then there's the Australian government's controversial refugee detention centre on Manus Island, off the north coast. It doesn't help that Port Moresby, the gateway to PNG for most visitors, has a reputation for being unsafe.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO There's more to PNG than the Kokoda Track, including: islands inhabited by some of the friendliest people in the Pacific, surf camps on New Ireland (see nusaislandretreat.com), dive resorts in Milne Bay near Alotau (see tawali.com), war history and active volcanoes around Rabaul and events that bring together people who speak more than 800 distinct languages, such as the Sepik River Crocodile and Arts Festival. Port Moresby also has a new Hilton Hotel, Harbourside dining precinct and Ela Beach revamp.\n\nWHEN TO GO Avoid the wet season, October-May.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY Minimise your time in Port Moresby and avoid walking around town alone after dark.\n\nESSENTIALS No Roads' 16-day Three Peaks Trek is an alternative to Kokoda and includes climbing the 4509-metre Mount Wilhelm, PNG's highest peak.

Despite all this, or perhaps because of it, Iranians are incredibly welcoming and many speak English; people will literally run up to you in the street, shake your hand and thank you for visiting.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO One of the world's most intriguing countries, Iran has incredible Islamic architecture, buzzing bazaars, a sophisticated culinary scene, snow-capped mountains north of Tehran, the ancient capital of Shiraz with its Pink Mosque and the city-palace complex of Persepolis, idyllic Persian Gulf beaches such as Qeshm and Kish, and Esfahan, said to be the world's most beautiful city.\n\nWHEN TO GO Spring (March-May) or autumn (September-November).\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY SafeTravel advises \"reconsidering your need to travel\" to Iran but you can reduce the perceived risk by joining a group tour. Female travellers need to wear headscarves but Iran is less conservative than you'd think, particularly in Tehran.\n\nESSENTIALS Intrepid Travel recently launched 12-day women-only trips to Iran, see intrepidtravel.com\n\nMYANMAR\n\n123 rf Esfahan is said to be the world's most beautiful city.\n\nWHY THEY WANT YOU After being \"flavour of the month\" a few years ago, Myanmar is now the least-visited country in south-east Asia. Tourism has slumped since late 2017 because of violence against the Muslim Rohingya people in northern Rakhine State and the ongoing refugee crisis. Myanmar is now promoting itself to China, South Korea and Thailand, but Western tourists reportedly stay longer and spend three times as much as Asian tourists.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO The multicultural capital Yangon, formerly Rangoon, is jam-packed with pagodas, synagogues, mosques, cathedrals and British colonial hotels such as The Strand. See the floating gardens and stilt houses on Inle Lake. Drift over the temples of Bagan in a hot-air balloon. Myanmar's remote Mergui Archipelago offers new experiences such as sea kayaking trips (see expeditionengineering.com) and cruising on a solar-powered yacht (burmaboating.com).\n\nWHEN TO GO Avoid the hurricane season (May-June) and the rainy season (July-October).\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY Boycotts generally hurt the people without having any effect on the policies that caused the issue.

But things are looking up: Istanbul's massive new international airport opened in October, new hotels have been built, including Six Senses' first Turkish resort, and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism expects 50 million visitors annually by 2023.\n\nWHAT TO SEE AND DO Istanbul is one of the world's great cities, dominated by Hagia Sofia, the 6th century orthodox church turned mosque turned museum, but there's also the Blue Mosque, the Topkapi Palace and the Grand Bazaar. The archaeological site of Troy is celebrating 20 years since its World Heritage listing with a new museum that opened last year and a calendar of events this year. Then there are the Hobbit-like caves of Cappadocia and an 8000-kilometre coastline dotted with white-sand beaches lapped by \"turquoise\" seas (the colour was invented to describe gemstones from Turkey).\n\nWHEN TO GO Summers are long in Turkey and the busiest time is mid-April to mid-September so dodge the crowds by visiting in spring or autumn.\n\nTREAD CAREFULLY Avoid all-inclusive resorts on the over-developed Aegean and Mediterranean coasts in favour of more sustainable lodgings that benefit communities.\n\nESSENTIALS See goturkeytourism.com"}]}, {"actual_city": "Panama", "occurence_timestamp": 1555494948936, "occurence_date": "17 Apr 2019", "magnitude": 5.1, "news": [{"title": "Volcano earthquake report for Wednesday, 17 Apr 2019", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes-volcanoes/news/78739/Volcano-earthquake-report-for-Wednesday-17-Apr-2019.html", "content": "Get our newsletter!\n\n: Excellent information and background for anyone wishing to visit active volcanoes safely and enjoyably.

It uprooted trees, ripped off roofs, set off landslides and flooded farms and roads.\n\nYet amid the suffering, there was also relief that the situation was not much worse. The initial casualty toll was far lower than officials had feared in the days before the storm made landfall early Saturday on the Philippines\u2019 largest and most populous island.\n\nIt could be days or weeks before the storm\u2019s true human toll is known. It will also take time to assess how much damage was done to the country\u2019s prime agricultural region and to the economy. Damage to farms could be extensive and costly for the nation. The region is the country\u2019s largest food producer, and the destruction of crops could lead to food shortages, higher costs and inflation.\n\nFrom the road above Robert Tumaneng\u2019s fish ponds on Saturday, the floodwaters extended as far as the eye could see, with the tips of palm trees and the thatched roofs of wooden shacks barely visible beneath the caramel-coloured water. \u201cIt was shaking like an earthquake,\u201d said Tumaneng (55), a fish farmer in the town of Claveria on Luzon\u2019s north coast. \u201cThis storm was different because the wind was low to the ground like it was crawling and destroying everything,\u201d he said after the storm hit.\n\nThe number of confirmed fatalities is almost certain to rise as people begin assessing damage from the typhoon. But if the numbers are limited, it will be, at least in part, a testament to the preparedness of authorities following disastrous storms in recent years.\n\nA man looks at a damaged house due to strong winds from Typhoon Mangkhut in Tuguegarao city in Cagayan province, northeastern Philippines on Saturday. Photograph: Aaron Favila/AP.\n\nDetermined not to see a repeat of Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 people in the central Philippines in 2013, officials had evacuated more than 105,000 people to temporary shelters before Typhoon Mangkhut hit. Communications in the disaster zone were hampered by power and cell service outages, and access was difficult in many places because of flooding and road closures, making it hard to evaluate the storm\u2019s full effect.\n\nTrees and coconuts were strewn across the roads, which were deserted except for volunteer crews removing debris and the occasional emergency vehicle. In one community after another, emergency workers reported downed trees and badly damaged buildings. Signs, tin roofs and gates that had been torn free flew about.\n\nPrompt evacuations\n\n\u201cAt this stage, it is still too early to understand the full impact of the typhoon,\u201d said Gina Maramag, spokeswoman in the Philippines for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. \u201cEarly indications suggest that the prompt evacuations made by local authorities have mitigated the impact on civilians.\u201d\n\nAmong the casualties was a family of four killed when a landslide struck their home in the Cordillera Mountains, south of Claveria, according to a top government official, Francis Tolentino. He spoke in a television interview from the disaster zone on Saturday evening.\n\nA CARE Philippines Emergency Response Team that reached the town of Aparri on the north coast reported that some structures were damaged by the storm, including an evacuation centre. But much of the surrounding area had yet to be assessed. \u201cThe northernmost towns of Cagayan are believed to be badly hit and it is still difficult to access these areas as of the moment,\u201d said Madel Montejo, a member of that emergency response team. \u201cThe people say they need food, water, dry clothes and shelter repair materials.\u201d\n\nThe Librador family inside their house, heavily damaged by typhoon Mangkhut, in Alcala, Philippines. Photograph: Jes Aznar/Getty Images\n\nThe typhoon, with wind speeds reaching 170 mph before reaching land, could have caused far more damage if it had hit Luzon farther south and closer to Manila, a city of more than 12 million people. The capital was hit by heavy rain and strong winds, with trees uprooted and flooding in some areas.\n\nMore than 1,600 families were evacuated after the Marikina River, which runs through part of the city, began rising quickly because of runoff from nearby mountains. Police said the body of a child, about 10 years old, was found floating in the river.\n\nA resident looks out from his flooded home in San Mateo town in Rizal Province in the Philippines on Saturday.

While winds had weakened, forecasts indicated it would still pack the power of a Category 2 storm when it came ashore, possibly near Maoming, a big petrochemicals centre. The area forecast to be affected has relatively few low-lying towns that would be vulnerable to the rising sea levels of a storm surge, and Guangdong, China\u2019s most populous province, has extensive experience with typhoons and is well prepared.\n\nResidents walk in floodwaters in San Mateo town in Rizal Province in the Philippines on Saturday. Photograph: Rolex De La Pena/EPA.\n\nIf Mangkhut shifts slightly to the north, though, it could hit Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta area, one of the world\u2019s most important manufacturing hubs and home to more than 60 million people. Hong Kong itself is quite resilient to typhoons and although heavy rain could trigger landslides, the former British colony is not especially vulnerable to flooding, with few low-lying areas. The sprawling river delta around it, however, is barely above sea level and has struggled with flooding despite years of investment in drainage systems. \u2013 New York Times"}, {"title": "Earthquake info : M4.4 earthquake on Sun, 16 Apr 23:28:00 UTC / 034 km N 21?

The presence of a lava flow over the active vent increases the possibility of a vent clearing explosion over the coming days to weeks and thus AVO is raising the Aviation Colour Code ORANGE and the Volcano Alert Level to WATCH.Cleveland volcano, located on the uninhabited Chuginadak Island in the Aleutian Chain, is monitored by only two seismic stations which restricts the AVO's ability to detect precursory unrest that may lead to an explosive eruption. Recently there were some problems with data transmission of ongoing geophysical monitoring so that seismic and infrared data were temporarily unavailable, but over the past weeks the volcano has been in constant low-level seismic unrest. Although satellite observations were mostly obscured by clouds over the past days, a possible steam emission has been noted that may be related to the effusion of lava in the summit crater.The last detected explosive activity at Cleveland volcano occurred at 21h49 on May 4, 2018 (local time) and generated an ash plume that rose to 6700 m (22,000 ft). The AVO reports that \u2018Occasional, short duration explosive activity with minimal to no precursory signals is common at Cleveland Volcano, and explosions may occur without warning. Explosions typically produce relatively small volcanic ash clouds that dissipate within hours; however, more significant ash emissions may occur as they have in the past.\u2019 KTVA reports in an online news article that Cleveland volcano is responsible for the only known fatality from an Aleutian eruption.

(Motoki Nagasawa)\n\nNAGO, Okinawa Prefecture--Opponents of moves to construct a new U.S. military base here were out in force by organizing a city parade calling for a \"No\" vote in the referendum to be held Feb. 24.\n\nThe march, like one held in a local festival, came two days after the Feb. 14 official start of campaigning on the issue of relocating the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan to the Henoko district off Nago, also in Okinawa Prefecture.\n\nThe project, relentlessly pursued by the Abe administration despite fierce local opposition over the unfairness of Okinawa hosting such a disproportionate number of U.S. military facilities in Japan, brought into play something rarely seen in Japan.\n\nIn national and other elections, efforts to sway the vote are not allowed under the Public Offices Election Law. But as the referendum is not subject to this restriction, opponents of the project have an opportunity to try to influence the vote.\n\nIn the march, participants paraded with banners screaming \u201cVote No,\u201d while chanting \u201cGo and vote.\u201d\n\nYoshihiro Ikehara, 81, was among the estimated 320 people who took part in the parade.\n\n\u201cExpressing our position in this manner may be more effective than using a typical campaign vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group that organized the parade is calling for the closure of the Futenma facility, which is located in a crowded residential area, fueling fears that the crash of an aircraft could have a devastating impact. However, the group opposes relocation within the southernmost prefecture, home to about 70 percent of all U.S. bases in Japan.\n\nThe central government, overriding strong local objections, has been forging ahead with work to reclaim land off the coast of Henoko for the project.\n\nThe referendum will ask voters to choose between favoring or opposing the relocation plan or not having an opinion either way.\n\nOpponents began their anti-relocation drive even before the official start of campaigning.\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 13, five women drove to a residential area of Uruma, a city to the south of Nago, where one of them got out and addressed residents through a loudspeaker while two others stood with anti-base banners. The remaining two made door-to-door visits.\n\nSuch activity is strictly prohibited during regular elections under the Public Offices Election Law.\n\nYoneko Odo, one of the two women who made house calls, posted fliers in the mailboxes of houses.\n\nEach time, Odo, 71, pressed the chime and a resident opened the front door, she presented a ballot sample and said, \u201cMark a circle in the box that states oppose.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of marking X in the box in favor of relocation just because you are so angry about the relocation (within Okinawa), or fear your vote will be rendered invalid.\u201d\n\nKeiko Igei, who also made door-to-door visits, she has been involved with many election campaigns in the past, but finds this experience the most exciting yet.\n\n\u201cWe can visit whomever we want and explain our stance and discuss things,\u201d said Igei, 72. \u201cI wish we could do this every day.\u201d\n\nShe said opponents are mulling whether to call on voters to cast opposition ballots by standing near the entrances of polling stations on voting day.\n\nThose in favor of the landfill project are also out in force.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party is pressing ahead with the controversial project, the ruling party's prefectural chapter decided that its members should be allowed to vote free of official party guidelines.\n\nHowever, LDP Lower House member Kosaburo Nishime, who hails from one of the constituencies in the prefecture, had more than 1,000 banners printed and distributed on streets that read, \u201cFavor Full Return of the Futenma airfield.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want voters to realize that the relocation to Henoko started with Okinawa\u2019s demand for the closure of the Futenma base,\u201d he said on Feb. 17. \u201cI thought we should show that there are people who support the relocation.\u201d\n\nIn a residential area in Ginowan, Tadao Henza, 73, was busy posting fliers in mailboxes calling for support for the base project.\n\nHe prepared 20,000 fliers and asked acquaintances to distribute them by hand.\n\nHenza, a former Ginowan municipal assembly member who supports the LDP, is not happy about the referendum as it does not mention the urgency of getting rid of the danger posed by the Futenma airfield.\n\n\u201cAs things continue this way, only the opinion of opponents of relocation seems to spread,\u201d he said.\n\n(This article was written by Kaigo Narisawa, Sei Ito and Kazuyuki Ito.)"}, {"title": "Earthquake info : M4.9 earthquake on Thu, 11 Apr 16:03:15 UTC / Ryukyu Islands, Japan - 6 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2281743/M4-Thu-11-Apr-Ryukyu-Islands-Japan.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

The affected area is sparsely populated, with a dispersed population living in remote, rural communities. There are no major urban areas in the immediate vicinity although there is a gas pipeline in the area. There were some minor landslides following the earthquake, but as of 26 February no damage to infrastructure or homes has been reported. (OCHA, 26 Feb 2018)\n\nAt 15.17 UTC on 26 February 2018, a major aftershock with a magnitude of 6.2 M occurred in the Southern Highlands province close to the location of the 7.5 M earthquake of 25 February. According to media, as of 27 February, at least 30 people have been killed and 300 have been injured, several houses have been buried due to landslides in the worst affected areas of Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. The search and rescue operations are still ongoing and the death toll is expected to rise. For the time being, local authorities have not requested international support. (ECHO, 27 Feb 2018)\n\nOn 1 Mar, an immediate State of Emergency has been declared for Highlands Earthquake Disaster areas in Hela, Southern Highlands, Western and Enga Provinces to expedite the restoration of essential public services. PNG government approved K450 million for relief operations and to restore services, as well as the formation of an Emergency Disaster Restoration Team and the Establishment of a Restoration Authority to manage long-term reconstruction efforts over a 4-year period. (Govt. PNG, 1 Mar 2018)\n\nAerial assessments have shown significant damage and large landslides, and it is estimated that up to 465,000 people may have been affected by the disaster. An estimated 247,000 people are likely to require immediate assistance. Water is reported to be scarce in affected areas due to damage to storage facilities and water sources. One of the main health facilities in the affected area, Mendi hospital, is reportedly experiencing disruption to both water and power supplies. (OCHA, 5 Mar 2018)\n\nA strong aftershock with a magnitude of 6.7 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in the Western province on 6 March at 14.13 UTC, approximately 30 km south-east of the major 7.5 M earthquake of 25 February. According to media, as of 7 March at 8.00 UTC, at least 18 people have been killed by the 6.7 M earthquake (ECHO, 7 Mar 2018).\n\nThe Government, private companies and humanitarian partners have focused initial relief efforts on communities in the worst-hit seven LLGs in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. Private companies and bilateral partners, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, play a critical role in the early phase of the response. They work closely with UN agencies, NGOs, CSO, FBOs and the Red Cross. Humanitarian partners have provided food to over 34,400 people in Nipa Kutubu LLG and Komo Magarima LLG. Up to 54,260 households are estimated to be in need of emergency shelter. To date, 100 households in Mount Bosavi LLG and another 100 households in Para/Moro have received shelter equipment. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 11 Mar 2018).\n\nOn 27 March 2018, the Parliament passed two bills formalizing the State of Emergency in earthquake-affected areas and establishing a Restoration Authority for the affected provinces. The first bill formalised the State of Emergency initially declared by Prime Minister on 2 March 2018, while the second establishes the WESH Restoration Authority, covering Western, Enga, Southern Highlands, and Hela, as well as parts of West Sepik and Gulf provinces...On 28 March, the Disaster Management Team (DMT) issued its initial earthquake response plan, which focuses on providing life-saving assistance and helping to re-establish basic services for 270,000 people in need of immediate assistance due to the 26 February 2018 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks and landslides...It calls for US$ 62 million to support urgent action in seven areas, including Food Security; Health and Nutrition; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; Shelter; Protection; Education; and Logistics Coordination. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 29 Mar 2018)\n\nHumanitarian operations in and around Tari, provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to the rise in tension and outbreak of inter-communal fighting since 28 March. US$ 43 million has been mobilized from the private sector for earthquake response and recovery, primarily as contributions to government efforts. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 5 Apr 2018)\n\nFollowing a 7.5 magnitude earthquake which hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and affected an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces, assessment teams visited 38 displacement sites in the Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of PNG between 10\u201327 March 2018. Data was collected from key informants including councilors, village leaders, church leaders, teachers and healthcare workers.\n\nThe assessments showed that the most urgent needs of the displaced populations were water and shelter first and foremost, as well as kitchen utensils and food. Displacement sites such as Lau, Timu and Levani located in Hela Province are extremely isolated and were identified to be in urgent need of food rations following the destruction of food gardens and the limited food supply available. Many of the affected populations also suffer from continued trauma as aftershocks of the earthquake continue to hit the region. (IOM, 20 Apr 2018)\n\nThe key social infrastructure assessment, primarily focusing on health and education facilities, concluded that total estimated cost of rehabilitating in Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces is approximately USD 105 million. Result of a mobile Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (mVAM) survey, conducted during 22 March to 12 April 2018, indicated that 14 per cent of 1,534 households contacted in affected areas were displaced. Nine of 31 households in Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people. (Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 7 May 2018)\n\nAs of 28 May 2018, 11,761 households (approximately 58,300 people) remain displaced, of which 1,672 households are staying in eleven care centres while 10,089 households are staying with host communities according to the latest figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June. (Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 28 May 2018)\n\nThe access to remote locations and communication remains a significant challenge faced by all actors. As violent clashes in some communities are frequent, the restriction of movement has delayed, or prevented, aid from reaching certain locations. As of 29 May, humanitarian organizations temporarily have suspended operations in Hela province due to several security incidents. Serious security concerns in some areas continue to hamper intervention. (IFRC, 29 May 2018).\n\nEarthquake response activities in the Southern Highlands Province have been suspended after an outbreak of violence in the provincial capital, Mendi. Following the result of a national court decision to dismiss an election petition in favour of the incumbent Governor, protestors attacked multiple public and private buildings. On 14 June, the PNG Prime Minister declared a State of Emergency in Southern Highlands Province. Relief activities in areas of the Southern Highlands Province not affected by the violence are ongoing.

(Wikimedia Commons)\n\nPingtung County offers some great opportunities to experience Taiwan\u2019s aboriginal communities and one of the best places to head to is Wu Tai Township, a center of the Rukai Tribe\uff08\u9b6f\u51f1\u65cf\uff09. Wu Tai Township is located high in the central mountain range and is worth the trip for the spectacular journey alone. This is made all the more impressive in spring when the plentiful cherry trees are in blossom.\n\nIn the town itself, you can visit the small but interesting Rukai Museum, which does offer some English translation. There are several Rukai Cultural tours you can take from here too, which offer an insight into the tribe and its cultural heritage. Just as absorbing is strolling around the town, where you can see aboriginal influences everywhere. The stone houses of Yanban Lane are particularly interesting. And of course, there is no shortage of opportunities to buy Rukai souvenirs and experience their traditional cuisine.\n\nHengchun Old Town (\u6046\u6625\u53e4\u57ce)\n\n\n\nHengchun Old Town. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMany visitors to Pingtung County drive past Hengchun without stopping on their way to Kenting. Often, they will see the go-kart tracks and cheap B&B\u2019s that line the main road and assume that sums the place up. But they are missing out on one of the region\u2019s gems. Hengchun is a beautiful historic town, which can boast some of the best-preserved city walls in Taiwan. Not only are all four gates intact, but a total of almost half of the wall\u2019s original length is also still standing and much of it can be explored and even walked along. This walk offers some great views of the town.\n\nAnother site worth checking out is the Chuhuo Scenic Area (\u51fa\u706b\u7279\u5225\u666f\u89c0\u5340) just outside the town. Its centerpiece is a natural burning gas feature, where you can cook eggs on a fire which is coming straight out of the ground. And if you get hungry, there are no shortage of great restaurants either. A popular choice is the Kitchen Swell Restaurant (\u8ff7\u8def\u9910\u684c\u8a08\u5283) which serves excellent western fare in a beautiful old hospital building close to the South Gate. It is also next door to a shop which was featured Cape No. 7, a popular Taiwanese film, and which attracts hordes of local fans.\n\nTaiwan Indigenous People\u2019s Cultural Park \u53f0\u7063\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u65cf\u6587\u5316\u5712\u5340\n\n\n\nTaiwan Indigenous People's Cultural Park. (Tripadvisor.com)\n\nIf Aboriginal culture is your thing, then another great spot to visit is the Taiwan Indigenous People\u2019s Cultural Park. The park was established in 1987 to help preserve the culture and artifacts of all Aboriginal tribes. It is a huge site and has exhibition on nine of Taiwan\u2019s native aboriginal tribes. Highlights include their waxwork exhibitions and the handicrafts room, where you can see many of the brightly colored items the tribal people made.\n\nLocated near Sandimen Township (\u4e09\u5730\u9580\u9109), the Park is also set in the midst of some spectacular mountain scenery. And while there is much to see and do inside, it is the opportunities to enjoy traditional outdoor activities and explore some of the authentic tribal cabins that are the highlight of many people\u2019s visit.\n\nWanan Riverside Park / Amawan Waterfall\u842c\u5b89\u89aa\u6c34\u516c\u5712/\u963f\u746a\u7063\u7011\u5e03\u7fa4\n\n\n\nWanan Riverside Park. (HouseFun News)\n\nGiven Taiwan\u2019s humid climate, playing in the water is always an attractive proposition and in Pingtung, there are few nicer places to do that than the Wanan Riverside Park. Situated in Wanan Village, the picturesque Riverside park offers plentiful opportunities for adults and children to play in the river itself. The water is clean as it flows straight from the mountains and while some caution is required, it is generally safe too.\n\nThe park does attract big crowds in summer, especially at weekends, and these also bring street traders who some visitors have reported being a little aggressive in their sales techniques. If you want to escape the hubbub and enjoy the water in an even more tranquil environment, the nearby Amawan Waterfall (\u963f\u746a\u7063\u7011\u5e03\u7fa4) is a great place to try as long as you don\u2019t mind a little light river tracing.\n\nXiao Liuqiu\u5c0f\u7409\u7403\n\n\n\nXiao Liuqiu. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nIf you have the time and can ride a scooter, then the island of Xiao Liuqiu is definitely worth the effort of a boat trip from Donggang (\u6771\u6e2f). This stunningly picturesque coral island does not allow cars, but scooters can be easily hired and a trip around the island is achievable for even the most novice of riders. It is a fantastic experience, with many natural phenomena to see.\n\nHighlights of Xiao Liuqiu include the Black Dwarf Cave(\u70cf\u9b3c\u6d1e), Vase Rock\uff08\u82b1\u74f6\u5ca9), and the Liuqiu Lighthouse (\u767d\u71c8\u5854). It is also a great place to go snorkeling and swim in the sea. There are several beaches, many of which boast unique coral features you can see. It is possible to do a trip to Xiao Liuqui in a day, but most people recommend spending one night there if you want to make the most out of your trip.\n\nMount Sihlinge Recreation Area - \u56db\u6797\u683c\u5c71\u904a\u6a02\u5340\n\n\n\nMount Sihlinge Recreation Area. (Pingtung Government Website)\n\nMount Sihlinge Recreation Area which is located not far from Hengchun Township in the heart of the mountains offers some unique and spectacular views. The local scenery itself is impressive and unspoiled with two natural lakes attracting an impressive array of flora and fauna as well as plenty of wildlife too.\n\nBut the highlight of Mount Sihlinge Recreation Area is the 360-degree panorama that can be enjoyed from the highest point. From here you can see all across the southernmost point of Taiwan and see Hengchun Peninsula, the Pacific Ocean, the Bashi Channel, and the Taiwan Strait. It is often overlooked by visitors but is truly one of the most spectacular vistas in the whole country.\n\nNational Museum of Marine Biology & Aquarium \u570b\u7acb\u6d77\u6d0b\u751f\u7269\u535a\u7269\u9928\u200b\n\n\n\nAquarium. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nTaiwan\u2019s National Aquarium is located just off Highway 26 outside Checheng and is well worth the diversion. It offers three huge aquatic exhibits featuring sea life from around the region and beyond. Currently, these are dedicated to separate exhibitions on Waters of Taiwan, Waters of the World, and Coral Kingdom.\n\nVisitors can also experience the largest underwater tunnel in Asia, which you can even spend the night in if you make arrangements in advance. There is also a 3D cinema and many more facilities to enjoy too. The Aquarium is a great place for families, big kids, and anyone with an interest in Taiwan\u2019s unique marine ecosystem."}, {"title": "Super Typhoon Trami unlikely to make landfall in Taiwan: CWB", "url": "http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201809250008.aspx", "content": "Taipei, Sept. 25 (CNA) The odds are slim that Super Typhoon Trami will make landfall in Taiwan, but its periphery could bring rain to the country, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nCWB forecaster Kuan Hsin-ping (\u5b98\u6b23\u5e73) said Super Typhoon Trami is expected to move closer to Taiwan starting Friday but is unlikely to directly hit the island.\n\n\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Tuesday, the storm was located about 880 kilometers east-southeast of Taiwan's southernmost tip and moving at a speed of 3 kilometers per hour in a north-northwesterly direction.\n\n\n\nIt is carrying maximum sustained winds of 191 kph and gusts of up to 234 kph.\n\n\n\nThe CWB said Typhoon Trami had slowed dramatically from its speed of 15 kph on Monday, and it is expected to slow further to below 2 kph over the next 12 to 24 hours.\n\n\n\nKuan said that with Trami approaching Taiwan, its periphery is expected to affect the local weather until the storm moves away, likely after Sunday.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the weather will remain under the influence of ongoing northeasterly winds that could result in downpours in certain parts of Taiwan during the day.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CWB, heavy rain is possible for Keelung and coastal areas in Taiwan, the Greater Taipei area and Yilan.\n\n\n\nIn central and southern Taiwan, sporadic showers are forecast for mountainous areas, the bureau said.\n\n\n\nDue to the rain, daytime temperatures in northern Taiwan are expected to range between a relatively comfortable 28 and 30 degrees Celsius, while central and southern Taiwan will face muggy conditions and temperatures of 32-33 degrees, Kuan said.\n\n\n\nShe said coastal areas in northern and eastern Taiwan, including Green Island and Orchid Island, and the Hengchun Peninsula, are likely to see high waves on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nStrong winds are forecast for northern and eastern Taiwan, the Hengchun Peninsula and the outlying Kinmen, Penghu and Matsu islands, Kuan said.\n\n\n\n(By Chen Wei-ting and Frances Huang)\n\nEnditem/ls"}, {"title": "Typhoon Kong-Rey downgraded, forecast to bring rain to Taiwan", "url": "http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201810030004.aspx", "content": "Taipei, Oct. 3 (CNA) Typhoon Cong-Rey was downgraded from a super typhoon Wednesday morning but will still start to bring rain to Taiwan on Thursday when the storm gets closer to the island, according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).\n\n\n\nCWB forecaster Lin Ting-yi (\u6797\u5b9a\u5b9c) said the typhoon, the 25th storm in the West Pacific Ocean so far this year, will approach Taiwan on Thursday but is not expected to make landfall on the island.\n\n\n\nThe CWB also does not expect to issue a sea warning for the typhoon, Lin said.\n\n\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the storm's periphery will bring heavy rain or even extremely heavy rain to northern and northeastern Taiwan, and other parts of the country will see some rain.\n\n\n\nAs of 8 a.m. Wednesday, Kong-Rey was located about 940 kilometers east-southeast from Taiwan's southernmost tip and was traveling in a northwesterly direction at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour, according to the CWB.\n\n\n\nKong-Rey was packing maximum sustained winds of 173 kph, with gusts of up to 209 kph, the CWB said.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Taiwan is expected to feel the lingering effects of northeasterly winds, which could strengthen during the day to bring rain, in particular in mountainous areas in the afternoon, Lin said.\n\n\n\nBecause of those winds, daytime temperatures are expected to stay little changed from a day earlier, with the mercury in northern Taiwan forecast to hit 26 degrees Celsius and to range between 30 and 31 degrees in central and southern parts of the country, Lin said.\n\n\n\nTemperatures at night should fall to 20-21 degrees in the north and 20-22 degrees in central and southern Taiwan.\n\n\n\nThe CWB said strong winds are forecast for Wednesday in eastern Taiwan and the areas north of Tainan as well as the Hengchun Peninsula and the outlying Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands.\n\n\n\nBig waves are forecast for the coastal areas in northern and eastern Taiwan, the Hengchu Peninsula and Matsu, the CWB said.\n\n\n\n(By Chen Wei-ting and Frances Huang)\n\nEnditem/ls"}]}, {"actual_city": "Nago, Japan", "occurence_timestamp": 1554696760096, "occurence_date": "08 Apr 2019", "magnitude": 5.5, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Sun, 14 Apr 08:45:55 UTC / 155km ESE of Nago, Japan -

(Motoki Nagasawa)\n\nNAGO, Okinawa Prefecture--Opponents of moves to construct a new U.S. military base here were out in force by organizing a city parade calling for a \"No\" vote in the referendum to be held Feb. 24.\n\nThe march, like one held in a local festival, came two days after the Feb. 14 official start of campaigning on the issue of relocating the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Ginowan to the Henoko district off Nago, also in Okinawa Prefecture.\n\nThe project, relentlessly pursued by the Abe administration despite fierce local opposition over the unfairness of Okinawa hosting such a disproportionate number of U.S. military facilities in Japan, brought into play something rarely seen in Japan.\n\nIn national and other elections, efforts to sway the vote are not allowed under the Public Offices Election Law. But as the referendum is not subject to this restriction, opponents of the project have an opportunity to try to influence the vote.\n\nIn the march, participants paraded with banners screaming \u201cVote No,\u201d while chanting \u201cGo and vote.\u201d\n\nYoshihiro Ikehara, 81, was among the estimated 320 people who took part in the parade.\n\n\u201cExpressing our position in this manner may be more effective than using a typical campaign vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe group that organized the parade is calling for the closure of the Futenma facility, which is located in a crowded residential area, fueling fears that the crash of an aircraft could have a devastating impact. However, the group opposes relocation within the southernmost prefecture, home to about 70 percent of all U.S. bases in Japan.\n\nThe central government, overriding strong local objections, has been forging ahead with work to reclaim land off the coast of Henoko for the project.\n\nThe referendum will ask voters to choose between favoring or opposing the relocation plan or not having an opinion either way.\n\nOpponents began their anti-relocation drive even before the official start of campaigning.\n\nOn the morning of Feb. 13, five women drove to a residential area of Uruma, a city to the south of Nago, where one of them got out and addressed residents through a loudspeaker while two others stood with anti-base banners. The remaining two made door-to-door visits.\n\nSuch activity is strictly prohibited during regular elections under the Public Offices Election Law.\n\nYoneko Odo, one of the two women who made house calls, posted fliers in the mailboxes of houses.\n\nEach time, Odo, 71, pressed the chime and a resident opened the front door, she presented a ballot sample and said, \u201cMark a circle in the box that states oppose.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of marking X in the box in favor of relocation just because you are so angry about the relocation (within Okinawa), or fear your vote will be rendered invalid.\u201d\n\nKeiko Igei, who also made door-to-door visits, she has been involved with many election campaigns in the past, but finds this experience the most exciting yet.\n\n\u201cWe can visit whomever we want and explain our stance and discuss things,\u201d said Igei, 72. \u201cI wish we could do this every day.\u201d\n\nShe said opponents are mulling whether to call on voters to cast opposition ballots by standing near the entrances of polling stations on voting day.\n\nThose in favor of the landfill project are also out in force.\n\nAlthough Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party is pressing ahead with the controversial project, the ruling party's prefectural chapter decided that its members should be allowed to vote free of official party guidelines.\n\nHowever, LDP Lower House member Kosaburo Nishime, who hails from one of the constituencies in the prefecture, had more than 1,000 banners printed and distributed on streets that read, \u201cFavor Full Return of the Futenma airfield.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want voters to realize that the relocation to Henoko started with Okinawa\u2019s demand for the closure of the Futenma base,\u201d he said on Feb. 17. \u201cI thought we should show that there are people who support the relocation.\u201d\n\nIn a residential area in Ginowan, Tadao Henza, 73, was busy posting fliers in mailboxes calling for support for the base project.\n\nHe prepared 20,000 fliers and asked acquaintances to distribute them by hand.\n\nHenza, a former Ginowan municipal assembly member who supports the LDP, is not happy about the referendum as it does not mention the urgency of getting rid of the danger posed by the Futenma airfield.\n\n\u201cAs things continue this way, only the opinion of opponents of relocation seems to spread,\u201d he said.\n\n(This article was written by Kaigo Narisawa, Sei Ito and Kazuyuki Ito.)"}]}, {"actual_city": "Neiafu, Tonga", "occurence_timestamp": 1554664499870, "occurence_date": "07 Apr 2019", "magnitude": 5.2, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.8 earthquake on Wed, 20 Mar 22:59:51 UTC / 208km SE of Hihifo, Tonga - 1 experience report", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2261580/M4-Wed-20-Mar-208km-SE-of-Hihifo-Tonga.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

In addition to the back-to-back titles Minnesota Duluth won in 2018 and 2019, Sandelin guided the Bulldogs to the championship in 2011. The UMD head coach is likely to garner some NHL attention as he did last offseason with how many jobs are open currently. \"If someday that ever pops up, I'll look at it for sure,\" Sandelin said earlier in the week about his future. \"Right now, I'm in a great situation. I've got a great group of players.\" Adding another title to his long list of achievements is sure to keep his name on a NHL lists.\n\nFrozen Four semifinals\n\nKeyBank Center, Buffalo, N.Y.\n\nMinnesota Duluth 4, Providence 1\n\nplay 0:40 UMass advances to championship after OT win UMass' Marc Del Gaizo sends a slapshot into the back of the net in overtime, sending the Minutemen into the NCAA hockey championship.\n\nESPN staff writer The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs will have a chance to defend their national title after downing Providence 4-1 in the 2019 Men's Frozen Four opener Thursday night. Justin Richards, son of former NHL head coach and current Tampa Bay Lightning assistant Todd Richards, scored the game's first and last goals to pace UMD to the semifinal victory. Meanwhile, junior goalie Hunter Shepard stayed hot in the playoffs by stopping 28 shots in his seventh straight victory. The Bulldogs hope to become the first repeat champions since Denver won back-to-back in 2004 and 2005. This also marks UMD's third consecutive trip to the national championship game, a feat last accomplished by Boston College from 2006 to 2008.\n\nMassachusetts 4, Denver 3\n\nESPN staff writer For the first time in school history, UMass will play for a men's hockey national championship. The Minutemen punched their ticket to the final in dramatic fashion as freshman defenseman Marc Del Gaizo blasted a one-timer for the overtime game-winning goal against Denver.

Some herds have shrunk by more than 90pc - \"such drastic declines that recovery isn't in sight\", this Arctic Report Card stated.\n\n\n\nThere are multiple reasons.\n\n\n\nProf Howard Epstein, an environmental scientist from the University of Virginia, who was one of the many scientists involved in the research behind the Arctic Report Card, told BBC News that warming in the region showed no signs of abating.\n\n\n\n\"We see increased drought in some areas due to climate warming, and the warming itself leads to a change of vegetation.\"\n\n\n\nThe lichen that the caribou like to eat grows at the ground level. \"Warming means other, taller vegetation is growing and the lichen are being out-competed,\" he told BBC News.\n\n\n\nAnother very big issue is the number of insects. \"Warmer climates just mean more bugs in the Arctic,\" said Prof Epstein. \"It's said that a nice day for people is a lousy day for caribou.\n\n\n\n\"If it's warm and not very windy, the insects are oppressive and these animals spend so much energy either getting the insects off of them or finding places where they can hide from insects.\"\n\n\n\nRain is a major problem, too. Increased rainfall in the Arctic, often falling on snowy ground, leads to hard, frozen icy layers covering the grazing tundra - a layer the animals simply cannot push their noses through in order to reach their food.\n\n\n\nBut scientists say we have opened the door on the \"world's freezer\" and the growing pile of evidence suggests warming in the Arctic will continue. The aim of this and other research in the region is to understand its impacts and learn how to adapt to a changing climate.\n\n\n\nThe report, complied by the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), is now in its 13th year and the administration's Arctic research programme manager, Emily Osborne, said the region was now in \"uncharted territory\".\n\n\n\n\"In all the years of publishing the report card, we see the persistence of the warming continuing to mount,\" she said. \"And this is contributing to extreme weather events elsewhere in the world.\"\n\n\n\nSome other key points from the report included:\n\n\n\nPlastic pollution: tiny microplastic contamination is on the rise in the Arctic, posing a threat to seabirds and marine life that can ingest debris.\n\n\n\nAir temperature: For the past five years (2014-18) temperatures have exceeded all previous records since 1900.\n\n\n\nSea ice thinning: In 2018 Arctic sea ice remained younger, thinner, and covered less area than in the past.\n\n\n\nToxic blooms: Warming Arctic Ocean conditions are coinciding with an expansion of harmful algal blooms in the ocean, which threaten food sources.\n\n\n\nAlso here at AGU, scientists have revealed that East Antarctica's glaciers have begun to \"wake up\" and show a response to warming. This is evidence of unprecedented climate-driven change at the top and bottom of the planet.\n\n\n\nUNi XC_SNU 1644"}]}, {"actual_city": "Mandali, Iraq", "occurence_timestamp": 1554113244170, "occurence_date": "01 Apr 2019", "magnitude": 5.2, "news": [{"title": "8 earthquakes jolt Iran-Iraq border within an hour", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-earthquakes-iraq-border-region-felt-baghdad-aftershocks/", "content": "TEHRAN, Iran -- A series of eight earthquakes hit the Iran-Iraq border area and rattled even Baghdad and parts of the Iraqi countryside on Thursday, apparently aftershocks of a temblor in November that killed over 530 people. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said seven of the quakes struck near the Iraqi city of Mandali and an eighth struck near Mehran in western Iran. All struck within an hour of each other, beginning at 0659 GMT.\n\nSeven had a preliminary magnitude of at least 5, while the eighth earthquake was a magnitude 4. Earthquakes of magnitude 5 and up to 5.9 are classified as moderate.\n\nIranian authorities offered similar figures for the earthquakes on state television.

In Baghdad, people felt a quake shake the Iraqi capital, followed by what felt like aftershocks.\n\nAll the earthquakes struck at a depth of 6 miles, according to the USGS. Earthquakes at magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. The temblors also all were very shallow, which causes more ground shaking and potential damage, particularly in places without strict building codes.\n\nIn November, a major 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck the same region, killing over 530 people and injuring thousands in Iran alone.

The epicentre of the quakes were Dhundalwadi village in Dahanu.District collector Dr Prashant Narnaware told TOI that Vaibhavi Bhuyal died in a mishap though as of now they are not attributing it to tremor.Vaibhavi was stepping out of her home in Haladpada in Talasari taluka of Palghar district when the tremor struck at 3.53pm. Vaibhavi tripped and fell on a rock, injuring her head. She was admitted to the Talasari rural hospital where she later died.Dr Narnaware who visited the affected villages on Friday said that a team of the NDRF has left Mumbai to set up around 100 tents in the villages.A total of 42 locations have been identified and put on high alert. Several hamlets in 12 villages have been moved out of their homes. Tribals have been asked not to stay in their homes.At Dhundalwadi work of erecting tents will be completed by night. All gram panchayats have been alerted and villagers have been moved to safety. The district disaster management plan has been activated.District officials and police have been asked to maintain a vigil in the villages throughout the night.Two wards in Vedanta hospital in Dahanu have been set aside in case of an emergency.In a statement released by the National Centre of Seismology --New Delhi they said that since November 2018, more than 10 earthquakes of magnitude more than three have occurred in the Talasari Taluka of Palghar district. \"The largest earthquake of magnitute 4.1 occured on February 1 which was preceded by three earthquakes of magnitute three and above on the same day. All these earthquakes have been recorded by the permanent seismological observatories operated by the National Centre of Seismology (NCS). All these earthquakes were followed by numerous after shocks of very small magnitute.\"It also stated that historically there have been several occasions in the central western india when earthquakes of small magnitute have occurred for a long period 3-4 months. \"Such activity has been categorized as 'earthquake swarm' and in these areas no large magnitude earthquakes occurred. However due to the complexity of the earthquake occurrence processes it will not be advisable and possible to declare the ongoing sequence may or may not lead to a large magnitude earthquake in this case in future. It is to submit that the earthquake prediction is not possible as on date. No proven scientific technique is available in any part of the world to predict future earthquake precisely with regards to space, time and earthquake magnitude. Hence civil and and housing structures are to be properly engineered as per the earthquake resistant building codes specified by the Bureau of Indian standards (BIS),\" it has stated.Starting from Friday morning, the first tremor of 3.3 on the richter scale was witnessed at 6.58am, again there was a tremors felt recorded at 10.03am and 10.29am. The largest earthquake tremor of magnitude 4.1 on the richter scale occured around 4 pm on Friday.In the afternoon once again tremors were witnessed at 2.06pm. All the four tremors were seen having a depth from the range of 5-10 km. Vasant Mahale, a resident of Dhundalwadi in Dahanu taluka that has been witnessing mild tremors since November last year, said that the frequent earthquakes has caused fear in their minds. They continue to spend their nights in the open.Owing to the repeated earthqake being witnessed in the area, the IMD has already installed a seismometer to get real-time updates on the tremors and measure the shocks.

Killari was at the epicenter of the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that snuffed nearly 10,000 lives in scores of villages across Latur and Osmanabad As many as 3,500 people died in Killari.

Poor monsoons and lack of basic facilities have arrested the progress of our village.\u201dKillari has seen little progress over the past 25 years. Civic works of a public water scheme, laying of drainage lines and construction of roads await government approval.The region has experienced 87 minor quakes since 1999. Sudhir Harhare, assistant meteorologist with the IMD\u2019s earthquake observatory in Latur, says, \u201cPrecautions are necessary because of the seismic activity in the region and earthquakes are highly unpredictable.\u201d But agencies mapping the tremors and the district administration authorities say they are more ready for emergencies than they were in 1993.The assistant professor of history at Savitribai Phule Pune University Babasaheb, Dudhbhate, remembers the early hours of September 30, 1993, every time he hears about an earthquake. \u201cFor 40 seconds, the vibrations shook the walls and roof of our house in Hasalgaon.

The rehabilitation after the huge rescue effort with several nations pitching in went on for three to four years, but later, the quake and its victims began to slip away from collective memory.Weak monsoons have affected farming and basic needs like water, roads and the promised economic development are nowhere near visible in many of the affected villages.Funds amounting to Rs 9.91 crore for the revival of public water scheme from CM\u2019s Relief Fund, another Rs 14.79 crore for construction or repair of roads and drainage system and a tranche of Rs 71.52 lakh for extension of public water scheme for Sarwadi village are awaiting approvals.

The epicentre of the quakes were Dhundalwadi village in Dahanu.District collector Dr Prashant Narnaware told TOI that Vaibhavi Bhuyal died in a mishap though as of now they are not attributing it to tremor.Vaibhavi was stepping out of her home in Haladpada in Talasari taluka of Palghar district when the tremor struck at 3.53pm. Vaibhavi tripped and fell on a rock, injuring her head. She was admitted to the Talasari rural hospital where she later died.Dr Narnaware who visited the affected villages on Friday said that a team of the NDRF has left Mumbai to set up around 100 tents in the villages.A total of 42 locations have been identified and put on high alert. Several hamlets in 12 villages have been moved out of their homes. Tribals have been asked not to stay in their homes.At Dhundalwadi work of erecting tents will be completed by night. All gram panchayats have been alerted and villagers have been moved to safety. The district disaster management plan has been activated.District officials and police have been asked to maintain a vigil in the villages throughout the night.Two wards in Vedanta hospital in Dahanu have been set aside in case of an emergency.In a statement released by the National Centre of Seismology --New Delhi they said that since November 2018, more than 10 earthquakes of magnitude more than three have occurred in the Talasari Taluka of Palghar district. \"The largest earthquake of magnitute 4.1 occured on February 1 which was preceded by three earthquakes of magnitute three and above on the same day. All these earthquakes have been recorded by the permanent seismological observatories operated by the National Centre of Seismology (NCS). All these earthquakes were followed by numerous after shocks of very small magnitute.\"It also stated that historically there have been several occasions in the central western india when earthquakes of small magnitute have occurred for a long period 3-4 months. \"Such activity has been categorized as 'earthquake swarm' and in these areas no large magnitude earthquakes occurred. However due to the complexity of the earthquake occurrence processes it will not be advisable and possible to declare the ongoing sequence may or may not lead to a large magnitude earthquake in this case in future. It is to submit that the earthquake prediction is not possible as on date. No proven scientific technique is available in any part of the world to predict future earthquake precisely with regards to space, time and earthquake magnitude. Hence civil and and housing structures are to be properly engineered as per the earthquake resistant building codes specified by the Bureau of Indian standards (BIS),\" it has stated.Starting from Friday morning, the first tremor of 3.3 on the richter scale was witnessed at 6.58am, again there was a tremors felt recorded at 10.03am and 10.29am. The largest earthquake tremor of magnitude 4.1 on the richter scale occured around 4 pm on Friday.In the afternoon once again tremors were witnessed at 2.06pm. All the four tremors were seen having a depth from the range of 5-10 km. Vasant Mahale, a resident of Dhundalwadi in Dahanu taluka that has been witnessing mild tremors since November last year, said that the frequent earthquakes has caused fear in their minds. They continue to spend their nights in the open.Owing to the repeated earthqake being witnessed in the area, the IMD has already installed a seismometer to get real-time updates on the tremors and measure the shocks. The seismometer instruments are at Dahanu in- Jamshet Dongripada Anganganwadi study room and another at Dahanu - Kasa Acharya Bhise School Lab.

The epicentre of the quakes were Dhundalwadi village in Dahanu.District collector Dr Prashant Narnaware told TOI that Vaibhavi Bhuyal died in a mishap though as of now they are not attributing it to tremor.Vaibhavi was stepping out of her home in Haladpada in Talasari taluka of Palghar district when the tremor struck at 3.53pm. Vaibhavi tripped and fell on a rock, injuring her head. She was admitted to the Talasari rural hospital where she later died.Dr Narnaware who visited the affected villages on Friday said that a team of the NDRF has left Mumbai to set up around 100 tents in the villages.A total of 42 locations have been identified and put on high alert. Several hamlets in 12 villages have been moved out of their homes. Tribals have been asked not to stay in their homes.At Dhundalwadi work of erecting tents will be completed by night. All gram panchayats have been alerted and villagers have been moved to safety. The district disaster management plan has been activated.District officials and police have been asked to maintain a vigil in the villages throughout the night.Two wards in Vedanta hospital in Dahanu have been set aside in case of an emergency.In a statement released by the National Centre of Seismology --New Delhi they said that since November 2018, more than 10 earthquakes of magnitude more than three have occurred in the Talasari Taluka of Palghar district. \"The largest earthquake of magnitute 4.1 occured on February 1 which was preceded by three earthquakes of magnitute three and above on the same day. All these earthquakes have been recorded by the permanent seismological observatories operated by the National Centre of Seismology (NCS). All these earthquakes were followed by numerous after shocks of very small magnitute.\"It also stated that historically there have been several occasions in the central western india when earthquakes of small magnitute have occurred for a long period 3-4 months. \"Such activity has been categorized as 'earthquake swarm' and in these areas no large magnitude earthquakes occurred. However due to the complexity of the earthquake occurrence processes it will not be advisable and possible to declare the ongoing sequence may or may not lead to a large magnitude earthquake in this case in future. It is to submit that the earthquake prediction is not possible as on date. No proven scientific technique is available in any part of the world to predict future earthquake precisely with regards to space, time and earthquake magnitude. Hence civil and and housing structures are to be properly engineered as per the earthquake resistant building codes specified by the Bureau of Indian standards (BIS),\" it has stated.Starting from Friday morning, the first tremor of 3.3 on the richter scale was witnessed at 6.58am, again there was a tremors felt recorded at 10.03am and 10.29am. The largest earthquake tremor of magnitude 4.1 on the richter scale occured around 4 pm on Friday.In the afternoon once again tremors were witnessed at 2.06pm. All the four tremors were seen having a depth from the range of 5-10 km. Vasant Mahale, a resident of Dhundalwadi in Dahanu taluka that has been witnessing mild tremors since November last year, said that the frequent earthquakes has caused fear in their minds. They continue to spend their nights in the open.Owing to the repeated earthqake being witnessed in the area, the IMD has already installed a seismometer to get real-time updates on the tremors and measure the shocks. The seismometer instruments are at Dahanu in- Jamshet Dongripada Anganganwadi study room and another at Dahanu - Kasa Acharya Bhise School Lab. These both are meant for seismic observations in Palghar District. The new one was recently installed at Vedant Hospital-- Dhundalwadi, Dahanu."}, {"title": "25 yrs on, an earthquake still feels like clear & present danger in Latur villages", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/25-yrs-on-an-earthquake-still-feels-like-clear-present-danger-in-latur-villages/articleshow/66013595.cms", "content": "Hichya mage tar konich urale nahi, ashich jagat aahe bichari\n\nMaking sense of 2019 #Electionswithtimes View Full Coverage\n\nKILLARI/SASTUR: The tremors haven\u2019t stopped. So the fear of the next big one lurks around even street corner, and weighs heavily on every conversation about what happened on this day 25 years ago in Killari, a village in Maharashtra\u2019s Latur district. Killari was at the epicenter of the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that snuffed nearly 10,000 lives in scores of villages across Latur and Osmanabad As many as 3,500 people died in Killari. For sole survivors like Chhaya Khajure, who lost her husband, four children and as many other family members, and now lives in the rehabilitated Killari village, life is a struggle. \u201c. (Nobody was left behind from her family. The poor woman is living with the grief),\u201d her neighbour says. \u201cI don\u2019t find any reason to live. Yet, I am, because committing suicide is a sin,\u201d she says.Before the earthquake, Killari, a village of 10,000 people, was a huge grain market. This unique identity has slipped away. Bapurao Birajdar, a grain supplier, says, \u201cIt (the earthquake) took away the livelihood of the farming community. Poor monsoons and lack of basic facilities have arrested the progress of our village.\u201dKillari has seen little progress over the past 25 years. Civic works of a public water scheme, laying of drainage lines and construction of roads await government approval.The region has experienced 87 minor quakes since 1999. Sudhir Harhare, assistant meteorologist with the IMD\u2019s earthquake observatory in Latur, says, \u201cPrecautions are necessary because of the seismic activity in the region and earthquakes are highly unpredictable.\u201d But agencies mapping the tremors and the district administration authorities say they are more ready for emergencies than they were in 1993.The assistant professor of history at Savitribai Phule Pune University Babasaheb, Dudhbhate, remembers the early hours of September 30, 1993, every time he hears about an earthquake. \u201cFor 40 seconds, the vibrations shook the walls and roof of our house in Hasalgaon. Then, there was a loud roar. Stone houses collapsed all around me and screams rent the air. I ran to an open area and was saved. Many died,\u201d he said, adding he could never get over the trauma.Back then, the human response to the devastation was among the few pluses. The rehabilitation after the huge rescue effort with several nations pitching in went on for three to four years, but later, the quake and its victims began to slip away from collective memory.Weak monsoons have affected farming and basic needs like water, roads and the promised economic development are nowhere near visible in many of the affected villages.Funds amounting to Rs 9.91 crore for the revival of public water scheme from CM\u2019s Relief Fund, another Rs 14.79 crore for construction or repair of roads and drainage system and a tranche of Rs 71.52 lakh for extension of public water scheme for Sarwadi village are awaiting approvals. A Rs 200-crore proposal for concrete roads and drainage lines in Nilanga taluka is also pending.In some villages, restricted ownership of the houses allotted under rehabilitation have stalled property transactions since the state is the owner. As many as 289 homes allotted under eighth and ninth rounds of rehabilitation in Killari village don\u2019t even allow restricted ownership of the houses.Jyotiram Ghayal, a 74-year old resident of Killari, counted eight deaths in his family, including his father, four daughters and a son. \u201cThe vacuum in our lives will end with our deaths. We often wonder who was more cruel to us \u2014 nature or destiny,\u201d he says.Septuagenarian Vishwanath Dalal from Sastur village in Osmanabad lost 18 family members. Hundreds of survivors were left permanently disabled. Still, a new sense of confidence made some orphans pick themselves up. Sajid Pathan\u2019s parents and three siblings died at Limbala-Dau village in Latur district. He was nine then. \u201cI went to an orphanage at Latur and completed my education and went on to work,\u201d he said. Sajid is a journalist.The calamity made the people of Latur equal sufferers. The state government has now planned public gardens in each earthquake-affected village in their memory. CM Devendra Fadnavis, along with NCP president Sharad Pawar, and senior Congress leader Shivraj Patil-Chakurkar will inaugurate the water conservation works in Latur and visit some of the quake-hit villages on Sunday."}, {"title": "Moderate intensity earthquakes rock Kashmir, Assam", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/moderate-intensity-earthquakes-rock-kashmir-assam/articleshow/65779040.cms", "content": "Earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale hits parts of Assam.

Of these attacks, 83 were deadly including 31 fatal attacks on children.\n\nThe saltwater crocodile population has rapidly recovered, after the government banned the export of crocodile skins in 1993.\n\nMeanwhile the Deputy Director of the Conservation Division, Joseph Hurutarau said although the number of attacks has indeed risen, there is still more research needed to be done to verify the the creature\u2019s exact population numbers.\n\n\u201cFrom these increasing attacks we can say that the number is increasing, but we cannot verify whether their actual population is increasing or are

With 18MM sellers this is a bit of a Nostradamus hubris causing some serious cognitive dissonance. One CEO actually declared he'd never hire a salesperson again but then a second glance revealed almost comically that all his customer service reps are actually already doing some pseudo transactional selling. It's been posited that 30% of field selling will be going away very soon.\n\nWould you agree? Is Sales as we know it going away to be replaced by AI or is it just morphing into something that is going to look a great deal more like a combination of sales and marketing?\n\nPhil Fernandez, the founder of Marketo, talks about the rise of the Director of Demand Generation in his prescient book \"Revenue Disruption.\" These futuristic specialists take a bold, data-driven approach to driving leads into the business. Perhaps the new roles that emerge toward 2020 will be something more towards this side of the spectrum and top of the funnel.\n\nI unleashed a furious debate on this topic in the Strategic Selling Group so I wanted to bubble it up to the LinkedIn Publishing Gods. There are two camps that seem to be emerging on this topic:\n\nCamp ONE: Let's just automate the blazes out of everything and run it all through a big dashboard! Spreadsheet jockeys rejoice in exaltation!\n\nCamp TWO: Complexity and commoditization may actually render the field seller even more relevant than ever before. After all, who's going to navigate the prospect through the morass of data and confusing solution sets?\n\nThere's an executive management viewpoint of lowering cost of sales but we don't want to rob Peter to pay Paul here. It's critical that core high-touch functions within enterprise customer accounts not be eroded by short term gain.\n\nI would posit a Camp THREE: The sales people of the future that win must be ninjas with Social Selling, analytics, consultative methods meet insight selling and have tremendous amounts of EQ meets business acumen.\n\nSimon Gibbard describes the sales leader of the future as follows: \"You get marketing. Marketing is the new sales, and you\u2019ve got your arms around it. You write copy. You get SEO, paid and earned media. You know how to promote a post on Facebook and LinkedIn. You\u2019ve got a Slideshare account and you use Buffer. Google alerts flag up opportunities to have new conversations. You speak the language of marketing and it makes you a better salesperson. The us and them days are over.\"\n\nDo you agree that Marketing is the new Sales? Or, as Peter Strohkorb has coined in his stirring manifesto, the age of \"SMARKETING!\" has arrived.\n\nOne thing is for certain, it's a battle royale to stay relevant: relevant to your own CEO with SVP of Sales attrition at an all-time high.\n\nAir Ross declared in his latest e-newsletter: \"Studies have said the average B2B sales team loses 27% of its members per year \u2013 whether they quit or are fired. That is INSANE!\"\n\nSo even before the Singularity emerges knocking us all out, we're already seeing enterprises hemorrhaging talent. Some of this could be chalked up to poor management and stratospheric targets coupled with an insidious lack of specialization, to be sure. It seems to be pre-quake jitters.\n\nThe modern sales practitioner must not risk becoming too specialized. Futurist Jacob Morgan extolls the learning worker over the knowledge worker as the knowledge worker gets paid for what he knows but the learning worker? She has the agility to adapt and constantly learn how to learn. That's what's so sensational about Jill Konrath's clairvoyant book Agile Selling, it truly allows a holistic approach to life-long learning and up-skilling in organizations.\n\nAbility to learn is the meta-skillset of the perma-employed, ever-adapting sales lion of 2050. I have no doubt!\n\nI've pulled some quotes from this debate for your reading pleasure. Please join the rousing global chorus in the comments below.\n\nMichael Bonner sounds off: \"Here's the problem. It turns out that the world does not actually get simpler over time. Marketing has no way to automatically assist someone with a complex decision. Even if they can come up with docs for every possible objection, the majority of people don't want to have to do all the study. How would they ever know when they knew enough. Complex decisions need discussion with experts. Review the studies that show that the quality of the selling experience was a major factor in many B2B and big-ticket sales. That probably won't change by 2020. Computers are a lot of things. Many of them wonderful. They are also cold, heartless, achingly stupid and insensitive (Okay, so it can replace some salespeople).\"\n\nJohn Smibert's contribution: \"The sales profession won't die (although many sales roles may). It will change and adapt as the world, and buyers in particular, change and adapt. The profession will find new (or modified) ways to create value for the buyer - to enable a fair exchange of value in ways that cannot be done without human interaction. I believe the sales profession has an exciting and changing future. I predict there will be wonderful new opportunities for salespeople in 2020. As always, those who change and adapt will survive and grow - and those that don't won't.\"\n\nShelly Revivo believes: \"Nonsense. Automation will innovate but the human element will always be critical. Automation simply helps with profitability and loss elimination of the 80/20 rule.\"\n\nAdam Thorp explains: \"The cost of sales is very very high. So what do you do \u2013 you automate. You automate to give sellers more time to sell and you automate to reduce the reliance on a large sales team. Using the 80/20 rule, in theory you can retain those top 20% or performers, still retain 80% of your revenue and see a significant increase in profitability due to the reduction in head count and cost of sale. Change in inevitable. You only have to look at the major players in sales performance management (ie CallidusCloud), sales enablement (ie SAVO), and sales automation (Insidesales.com) to see where the market is going. I remember less than 3 or 4 years ago people saying marketing automation was a just a fad and couldn\u2019t be effective \u2013 just look at that space now.\n\nTracey Preston Cook's mind blowing contribution: \"65% of all new careers that will be in existence 10 years from now, have not even been fully identified and many are not currently understood. Most are based on technology either emerging now, or disruptive technologies that are yet to be developed. The question we are asking about sales is one that taps into the fear of our selling futures (I've felt it too - it's normal to fear). It's why we pay attention to predictive statements...positive or negative. What you are selling will change many many many times...that's why you should learn everything you can about sales. Read everything not nailed down. Watch everything not obscured. Listen and observe the best. Learn. Learn. Then learn some more.\"\n\nIvonne Teoh reads the tea leaves: \"With longer lifespans of 140+ (ask your insurance agent), I wonder what the governments have in mind with new advances of technology and AI for the population. Less people working (displaced by robots), how to support that lifestyle. Gschwandtner may be wrong about the exact year, but it is still on the cards? I don't like telemarketers! They ring at the wrong time, some even selling funeral insurance! Being forced to make a decision where I'm not given enough time to check the info, is a big turn off.\"\n\nNow it's your turn: Is it just a little history repeating or will sales fall away? Do you believe field sales is toast to be replaced by holo-conferencing? Is the field of sales stronger than ever? What's your message to the CEO of tomorrow as she's looking to make the call on hiring sales leaders? What mix of live salespeople and sales automation is ideal?\n\nIf you valued this article, please hit the \u2018like' button and also share via your Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+ and Facebook social media platforms.

A big downpour could bring landslides in hillsides already destabilised by the earthquake, cause floods and contaminate water,\" said Udaya Regmi, director the International Red Cross in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe Red Cross said its initial assessments indicate as many as 143,000 people could have been affected, with an estimated 500 injured and 17,000 displaced from their homes. Even in more accessible areas of the country, health facilities have been damaged.\n\nExxonMobil, which shut its $19-billion PNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) project after the first quake, said Wednesday its facilities in Hides, where it runs a gas conditioning plant, were safely shut in.

We sent a travel writer to celebrate them.", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/magazine/trump-insulted-these-countries-travel-writer-celebrates-them/", "content": "Last year Trump called these countries a profane name. We sent a travel writer to celebrate them. Haiti El Salvador Liberia Warning: This graphic requires JavaScript. Please enable JavaScript for the best experience.\n\nIn a presidency abounding with profane language, Donald Trump saved his most bitter remark for immigrants. You likely remember the comment. \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" Trump asked in a closed-door 2018 meeting with mostly Republican senators, as reported by The Washington Post later that day. He went on to identify Haiti, El Salvador and Africa as the countries in question \u2014 never mind that Africa is a continent \u2014 and he reserved special animus for Haiti. \"Why do we need more Haitians?\" he asked, according to people familiar with the meeting. \"Take them out.\"\n\nTrump would later claim he never used the s-word, but Raj Shah, then a spokesman for the White House, did not deny the slur, and when Jesse Watters, a co-host of Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Five,\u201d considered Trump\u2019s tirade, he embraced it as a populist manifesto. \u201cI think it\u2019s either fake news, or if it\u2019s true, this is how the forgotten men and women in America talk at the bar,\u201d Watters gushed.\n\nI had a different reaction. To me, Trump\u2019s descriptor dehumanized several million individual lives, and it carried a troubling logic: If Haiti, El Salvador and African countries could be dismissed with an expletive, why worry about their fates as countries, or about how their problems have been caused partly by U.S. policy?\n\nAs a travel writer, I try to regard other nations as hopeful places filled with intriguing surprises. But arguably, I was a little complicit in Trump\u2019s insolence. Though I\u2019d visited 30-odd countries, I\u2019d never been to Haiti or El Salvador, and my travels in Africa had been tentative, cautious. The president had denigrated places that even I deemed too broken for tourism. As he often does, he\u2019d stirred the pot with an assertion rooted not in facts, but in something deeper: a widely held fear.\n\nWhat if I responded to the president by packing my suitcase? Wasn\u2019t it time for somebody to take the \u201cShithole\u201d World Tour? I developed a plan. I\u2019d travel to Haiti, El Salvador and an African country to gauge how Trump\u2019s insult registered. I\u2019d seek out, too, the complexity and the beauty that all slurs ignore \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t just do this to push against Trump\u2019s worldview. I\u2019d also do it for my own sake. Isn\u2019t the whole point of travel to go deep into the culture of a place, and then to return home feeling that you\u2019ve enlarged and brightened your own small world?\n\nA funeral wreath is delivered via motorcycle in Petion-Ville, Haiti. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post) I. Haiti\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nThe streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, are clotted with traffic at all hours. The idling cars billow plumes of smoke as they crawl along the pocked pavement. The drivers honk, sounding an erratic symphony in the still heat. Pedestrians weave through the stalled cars, and the sea glimmers in the bay. Sometimes the green of the mountains is visible through the smog.\n\nI\u2019ve decided that one way to understand this country would be to focus on its cuisine, so on a steamy morning in June, I\u2019m sitting on the porch of my hotel, awaiting Haiti\u2019s most famous chef. David Destinoble, 38, has served as the personal chef to Haiti\u2019s prime minister and now runs two Port-au-Prince restaurants. A Haitian native who spent most of his childhood in Miami before moving back to the Caribbean in 2015 after working for many years in Florida restaurants, he\u2019s starred on and co-produced a TV show, \u201cLe Chef,\u201d that focuses on Haitian staples: pumpkin soup, beef stew, poulet aux noix and griot, which is fried pork shoulder. When he shows up, he\u2019s driving a Chinese motorcycle, a Haojin dirt bike. He is tall and bald and sardonic, and at the moment he\u2019s smirking. \u201cAh,\u201d he says, \u201cthe white guy\u2019s gonna get a little taste of Haiti.\u201d\n\nI climb on the back, and we inch our way into the street. We\u2019re moving so slowly the bike barely balances, but then gradually \u2014 it\u2019s like music finding its groove \u2014 we begin slaloming through stalled traffic. We start charging into the left lane at times, straight at oncoming cars, so that for 10 or so seconds at a stretch we\u2019ve got our own wide-open swath of pavement and we delight in the breeze.\n\nWe\u2019re wending skyward toward Kay Chefs, a small bistro Destinoble runs 45 minutes out of town, in a chic hillside suburb called Laboule. I\u2019m not wearing a helmet, and I\u2019m aware of my skull as a fragile egg. In frightening moments, my grip on Destinoble\u2019s ribs goes extra tight. He keeps flying uphill, amused by my terror.\n\nDestinoble did not move back to Haiti to be cautious. Weekends, he drives his Jeep \u2014 \u201cColonel Black Mamba,\u201d he calls it \u2014 into Haiti\u2019s most remote villages, so that he can treat locals to delectable meals cooked on his tailgate. When Hurricane Matthew hit in 2016, he spent three months roaming the countryside, feeding the homeless and hungry.\n\nAt World Central Kitchen\u2019s new culinary school in Port-au-Prince, chef Natacha Gomez sprinkles spices on fried green plantains as students Lusette Jean, Stanly Albert and Kerby Gay look on. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post)\n\nHe wasn\u2019t alone on the mission. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, has a close-knit community of young chefs who know that their nation\u2019s woes are deeply rooted in food. In recent decades, Haiti has consistently imported more than half the food it consumes. Its agricultural sector took a severe blow in 1995, when President Bill Clinton began paying subsidies to U.S. farmers flooding the tiny country with rice grown in his home state of Arkansas. Haitian farmers couldn\u2019t compete with the cheap import, and many fled the countryside to live in sewerless shantytowns ringing Port-au-Prince. Meanwhile, in the grocery stores Destinoble frequents, wealthier Haitians now fill their carts with processed American food: Froot Loops, canned corn, Cheetos. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an inferiority complex,\u201d Destinoble says.\n\nThe new Haitian cuisine is about pride, and it was born, arguably, in September 2011, when a chef named Stephan Durrand founded the annual Haiti Food & Spirits Festival in Port-au-Prince, convinced, in his words, that Haitian dishes added up to more than \u201cethnic food that you get in a Styrofoam box.\u201d Port-au-Prince now boasts its own culinary school, and there are currently a half-dozen high-end restaurants where the draw is always a Haitian maestro doing interesting things with passion fruit or grilled conch.\n\nAs Destinoble sees it, all of Haiti\u2019s bruised beauty can be compressed into the words \u201clocal food.\u201d When we finally reach Kay Chefs, he tells me that, as a child, he came back to Haiti every summer for Boy Scout camp. \u201cWe did manly stuff,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d go into the jungle and find edible flowers and wild herbs \u2014 rosemary, chives, thyme. We killed birds with slingshots and cooked them over a fire. We set traps for rabbits.\u201d\n\nDestinoble serves me some goat, just slaughtered, and then he continues his stories, now reaching back to remember his most formative days growing up in a Haitian coastal city, Saint-Marc. When he was 5, he says, his mom let him join a few sinewy fishermen as they took part in a day-long ocean race. Then, out on the sea, one young fisherman, Maurice, dropped oil and a scallion into a pot on the boat\u2019s stove. \u201cThat pot just sizzled,\u201d Destinoble remembers, \u201cand I was hot and tired and hungry. That scallion was the best thing I ever smelled.\u201d\n\nLater, Maurice added fish and grated coconut to the pot. \u201cIt was my first time ever on the ocean,\u201d Destinoble says. \u201cThat day was a big deal for me, and the fish stew that guy made, I\u2019ve been chasing after that taste my whole life.\u201d\n\nWhen Destinoble mentions that he saw Maurice last year, a vision of the perfect Haitian meal pops into my mind. What if Destinoble and I traveled to Saint-Marc and cooked Maurice a pot of fish stew? Destinoble loves the idea. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave early,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll find him up there. It\u2019ll be great.\u201d\n\nOver the next few days I linger about Port-au-Prince, mostly waiting for Destinoble to call or text but also meeting with his nouveau-cuisine allies. One afternoon I join Stephan Durrand, 46, to get dinner up in Kenscoff, the high mountain village where he grew up. As we drive alongside a cliff overlooking the sea, he gives me a primer on Haitian food. \u201cIt\u2019s the cuisine of slaves,\u201d he says, \u201cwith influences from the conquerors \u2014 French, Spanish, English. We have a Mom\u2019s cuisine, just like the Italians. Historically, there weren\u2019t professional chefs, and men didn\u2019t cook. They were out in the fields, working.\u201d\n\nYoung men play soccer in the street after several roads were blocked because of recent social protests in Haiti. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn 2018, Durrand traveled with seven other Haitian chefs to the James Beard House in New York for a Haitian all-stars evening. He hopes that, with food, he can \u201cwage diplomacy and show Haiti off to the world.\u201d But he concedes that his efforts are but tiny drops in the stream of Haitian history.\n\nHaiti began so hopefully, in 1804, as the world\u2019s first independent black nation, but by 1806 the United States was already causing Haiti problems. Along with France and Spain, it refused to trade with Haiti, lest its freed blacks inspire mutiny among Americans still in bondage. America\u2019s bitterness toward Haiti lasted until Emancipation, helping to destabilize and impoverish the smaller nation. For over a century, Haiti was led by a seemingly endless string of corrupt dictators. Between 1915 and 1934, the United States occupied Haiti.\n\nIn the 1980s the Reagan administration propped up a Haitian dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier, a.k.a. Baby Doc, who had a penchant for torturing and killing his citizens. A decade later, the United States supported Haiti\u2019s first popularly elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a priest, and even went so far as to reinstate him after a military coup.\n\nBy the late 1990s, though, Haiti had become a transfer point for Colombian cocaine en route to college campuses and suburban homes in the United States. Coke was the way to wealth for many Haitians, and accusations of drug dealing swirled around Aristide. He was never indicted, but in February 2004, a U.S. Navy SEAL team facilitated a deadly Haitian coup by escorting Aristide onto a flight bound for the Central African Republic.\n\nThen, in 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck just outside Port-au-Prince. It killed more than 200,000 people and threw hundreds of thousands more into makeshift homeless camps that are, even today, still raging with cholera, which was brought in by U.N. peacekeepers. \u201cThis has just become a harder country since the earthquake,\u201d Durrand says. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t as joyous. We don\u2019t feel as safe.\u201d Indeed, Durrand seems to have integrated the stress himself. He\u2019s an irritable driver, cursing others on the road, shouting, \u201cWhat are you doing, my friend?\u201d\n\nWhen at last we reach the Kenscoff street market, the tension slips out of his shoulders. We soon find his culinary hero, and he\u2019s delighted. Marie Denis is \u201cthe best griot chef in the world,\u201d he tells me. She\u2019s a lean older woman, simply dressed and very shy as she tends to a metal pot bent and battered with age. \u201cI bought griot from her when I was a kid coming home from soccer practice,\u201d Durrand says. \u201cThe new Haitian cuisine starts with people like this.\u201d\n\nDenis smiles, demurely, and then, for $2.25, I get a couple of crispy knuckles of griot, each one blackened here and there, shiny with oil, and sour and salty as they rest on a bed of pikliz, a vinegar-rich, lime-tinged coleslaw. \u201cWhat you\u2019re tasting is the sour orange,\u201d Durrand says. \u201cThey kill their own pigs early in the morning. Then they bathe them in sour orange, to kill the bacteria. It\u2019s an African tradition.\u201d He tells me all this slowly and precisely, his tone reverent. Then, to ensure I get the undiluted street-dining experience, he orders from Denis a bottle of clairin \u2014 moonshine made from distilled sugar cane.\n\nThe clairin is syrup set on fire, and as we drink, Denis just stares at Durrand, silently, dotingly \u2014 reveling, it seems, in how he\u2019s all grown up now. At one point, I attempt to ask her about pig butchery, just to crack the ice, but Durrand, who\u2019s acting as my interpreter, cuts me off with a cool glare. Amid all the trials of Haitian life, he and I have arrived at a sweet island of solace, and right now it\u2019s my job to be quiet: It is wrong to parse paradise.\n\nWomen sell vegetables at an open-air street market in Petion-Ville.

Salter/For The Washington Post) Concrete homes on a hillside above Port-au-Prince. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post) The street market in Petion-Ville. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post)\n\nI keep sending Destinoble texts about our trip to Saint-Marc. I call. No response. So one day, to kill time, I wake at dawn and ride a mototaxi, then a tap tap (a minivan bus), then another couple of mototaxis into the hills, determined to summit the highest mountain in a mountainous country. Pic la Selle, elevation 8,793 feet, is roughly 50 miles southeast of Port-au-Prince and rather elusive. There are no road signs pointing the way, no formal trails, and much of the route there is not a road, really, but rather a motorcycle path so steep and so rubbly that twice I climb off my mototaxi and walk for fear of being pitched off the back.\n\nThe air grows thin and cool. In a village, locals point me toward a walking path that curves past a small family home, then past a few alpine gardens before cutting straight up a gravelly ridge. After about half an hour on the path, I find myself on an incline so steep that I\u2019m crabbing over the loose rock on all fours. I give up, but then, as I\u2019m descending, I meet a Haitian boy, maybe 14, who\u2019s loping skyward in a chamois shirt, a scarf and a ski cap, a machete dangling from his belt.\n\nI suspect he\u2019s herding goats. He speaks only Creole, but invoking intricate sign language, he and I broker a deal: For $3, he will lead me to the apex of Haiti. For half an hour I follow him \u2014 through a meadow dotted with daisies, then over slabs of white quartz past a few yucca bushes until, finally, we are standing atop a high, blustery peak appointed with a few spindly pine trees.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me seven hours to get here from my hotel, but when I gaze right I discover that, in fact, I have not climbed Pic la Selle. The plateau we\u2019re standing on slopes up, so that a few miles away it\u2019s higher than we are. I look over at my new friend, slightly miffed. He just smiles at me, shrugging, as if to say, \u201cC\u2019est la vie.\u201d\n\nHaiti\u2019s top chefs all know one another, so on another day, I get an invite to a new culinary school, opened last year by World Central Kitchen, a Washington-based nonprofit. The school sits on the smartly renovated top floor of a lavish private home carved into a hillside, and it has no exterior walls, so that tropical breezes can flow in, under the roof. When I arrive, seven college-age Haitian chefs are assembled around a gleaming bank of chrome stoves, dressed in white smocks and chef\u2019s hats as they stand at attention watching a master chef, also Haitian, show them how to prepare griot.\n\nHaitian griot (fried pork chunks) with fried green plantains. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post)\n\nAfter a while, I\u2019m directed to a table by the balcony. Fine cutlery is set upon the white tablecloth, and there\u2019s a goblet of freshly squeezed passion fruit juice, as well as a view of the green hills that slope down to the bay. There\u2019s only one place setting. Could I feel more honored?\n\nOne student brings me a small savory portion of griot atop a crisp pale green lettuce leaf. Another replenishes my glass of juice. The building\u2019s owner, a chef named Mi-Sol Chevalier, comes by, eventually, and tells me that her home had four levels until the earthquake ripped it apart. \u201cI will be 68 next month,\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband has passed away. I wanted to see young people doing my profession. This country needs chefs.\u201d A breeze sways the palm trees below me. Birds flit about in the canopy, and I think that, yes, maybe fine cuisine will bring Haiti back from the brink.\n\nThe next day, I take lunch at the swank Asu Rooftop Lounge, where the chef, Melissa Francois, serves me chicken in a creamy sauce made lemony yellow and vaguely bitter by a mild citrus fruit common in Haiti, the yellowish-green, orange-size bergamot.\n\nFrancois, who\u2019s 35, grew up in Haiti regarding Uncle Ben\u2019s rice as a delicacy. Her parents weren\u2019t cooks, and she knew of bergamots only because her grandmother rubbed them in clean clothes \u201cto give them that fresh smell,\u201d she explains. When she finally learned about Haitian cuisine as an adult, she was struck by how each part of Haiti is different, offering up its own signature dishes. \u201cWhere I grew up, in Port-au-Prince, we have a corn porridge called AK100, which is rather liquidy and cooked with allspice leaves. In Jacmel,\u201d she says, naming a Haitian city, \u201cthey eat their porridge as a solid, wrapped in a banana leaf and sweetened with cane. On the road to Jacmel, there\u2019s a lady who sells coffee mixed with ginger tea. You\u2019d never think of mixing those things, but it\u2019s marvelous. It\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d Francois is now at work with other chefs on a cookbook, \u201cHaiti of My Belly,\u201d that highlights the country\u2019s regional cuisines.\n\nOn my last day in Port-au-Prince, Destinoble and I head up to Saint-Marc. We travel north in a tap tap (his wife has the car), and as we\u2019re boarding at the Port-au-Prince bus stop, street hustlers mob us, angling to tow my suitcase and calling out Destinoble\u2019s name \u2014 \u201cChef David!\u201d \u2014 in their bid for coin. Destinoble regards them sourly. \u201cHaiti is the last pirate stronghold,\u201d he tells me. \u201cEvery person here is a business. I didn\u2019t say they have a business. They are a business. They\u2019re pirates, and they operate in a world with no paper trails, no taxes. It\u2019s a free-for-all.\u201d\n\nOur tap tap starts rolling, and Destinoble shifts in his seat, pained, trying to get a smidgen more legroom, for he has recently injured his knee crashing his motorcycle onto the gravel. When one young passenger tosses a potato chip bag out the window, Destinoble goes off. \u201cThere was once a great age in Haiti,\u201d he tells me, alluding to 1804, when Haitian slaves overthrew their French overlords, \u201ca time when there were not males, but men. Those Haitians who fought for freedom. But we couldn\u2019t last a day in their shoes. We\u2019re weak-minded. We don\u2019t care about nation-building. We care about self-building.\u201d\n\nSince he\u2019s slamming Haiti, I ask him how he reckons with Trump\u2019s vulgar snipe. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cMr. Trump has First Amendment rights. He can say what he wants, but when you say that the place where my father was born, and where my mother was born, is a \u2018shithole\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s hard to swallow.\u201d Destinoble shakes his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe\u2019re just like the hard-working people Mr. Trump talks about at his rallies. We have the same priorities: a safe country, a good life for our children. Yeah, I want to make Haiti great again. Of course I do.\u201d\n\nWe do not find Maurice. We meet with fishermen by the bay in Saint-Marc and discover that no one has seen Maurice in months \u2014 that he may even have died. As we eat a dismal lunch at a fast-food restaurant, Destinoble is glum and largely silent. We don\u2019t cook anything at all. Around 2 p.m., along with one of his cousins, he guides me to the Saint-Marc bus station for the six-hour journey toward a beachside city called Cap-Haitien, where I\u2019ll catch my flight out.\n\nA man offers fresh bread for sale. (Jeffery A. Salter/For The Washington Post)\n\nFirst, I ride a tap tap north of Saint-Marc for a little over an hour to Gonaives. It\u2019s a bigger city, so I figure I can get an air-conditioned bus from there. No such luck. The market is a scrum, a sweltering, busy, unshaded place. Two or three entrepreneurs stalk me. Meanwhile, several street vendors regard me with watchful concern, shouting out travel tips, trying to make my layover painless and smooth.\n\nWhen I find an idling pickup truck poised to transport passengers to Cap, I climb in the back \u2014 and soon learn that I\u2019ve picked a popular vehicle. As we wind up into the mountains on sinuous, switchbacking gravel roads, a plume of dust rising from the rear tires, there are 17 other people in the pickup bed with me. We are so intertwined that we are dripping sweat onto one another. We\u2019re in for a four-hour journey, and no one here seems to speak English. Or Spanish or French. I try to absent myself by reading a Philip Roth novel on my phone.\n\nBut the small dramas around me win my attention. There\u2019s a young man, 20-ish, riding on the bumper, clutching a side rail for balance, a bandanna over his mouth against the dust. When we come to a solitary backcountry house, moving 20 mph, he lets go of the rail. He floats over the road a second before smacking down onto the dirt. Then, nonchalant, he stumbles into the house.\n\nPassengers come and go. A mother gets on with a baby, and, as there is no single space big enough for her and the child, she entrusts him to a stranger and then sits serenely atop a bag of rice, watching as other strangers coo at the child. When a teenager gets on, he body surfs his way into the vehicle before settling, back first, onto his fellow passengers. Everyone laughs. Night falls.\n\nI think of what Destinoble said about \u201chard-working people.\u201d There\u2019s a perseverance, a fortitude, at work here in the back of this pickup. Public transit shouldn\u2019t look like this in the 21st century, not on an island that sits only a few hundred miles from the United States, and yet the passengers around me are able, at times, to revel in joy. It\u2019s a hard-earned joy, and I\u2019m feeling now what I tasted in the food that I ate, grown out of the ashes of Haiti\u2019s hard history. It was there at the market in Kenscoff when Stephan Durrand signaled me to stop asking questions, and also in Destinoble\u2019s longing for that fish soup. We roll into the outskirts of Cap. The passengers gather their belongings and climb out of the truck. One by one, they trundle home.\n\nLa Dalia billiards hall in San Salvador. (Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post) II. El SAlvaDOr\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nThere are no direct flights from Haiti to El Salvador. The world\u2019s two named \u201cshithole\u201d countries are both satellites of the United States, meaning I have to fly through Miami. The flights are not long, and when I land in San Salvador, the nation\u2019s capital, I\u2019m briefly in culture shock. There are bright street lamps here, and the pavement is flat and smooth as I glide along in a taxi.\n\nStill, I\u2019m scared. El Salvador has been the most murderous nation in the world since 2014, according to the Igarap\u00e9 Institute, a Brazilian think tank. The problem is gangs. From 1980 to 1992, the nation played stage to a civil war that became a Cold War proxy battle between the United States and the Soviet Union. Eighty thousand Salvadorans died, many at the hands of death squads and army units trained by the Americans, and afterward Salvadorans moved to the United States by the hundreds of thousands. Some young Salvadoran men felt so adrift and alienated that they got tattoos on their faces and, in Los Angeles, formed a street gang whose mantra is \u201ckill, rape, control.\u201d\n\nIn the 1990s, as MS-13 lived up to its stark promise, the United States began deporting gangsters en masse. Today, as MS-13 fights another gang, Barrio 18, for control of San Salvador, the city is rife with invisible barriers \u2014 lines that delineate the turf of each gang. San Salvador\u2019s homicide rate has fallen dramatically since 2015, perhaps because its gangs are increasingly moving from murder to gun and drug sales, but it remains the most dangerous city in the world\u2019s most dangerous country.\n\nLuckily, I\u2019ve got the phone number of a local. I call him, and a half-hour later we\u2019re in a decrepit downtown billiards hall, La Dalia, where fluorescent lights flicker over the pool tables and the ornate tile floors bespeak a time, some 70 years ago, when the dons of El Salvador\u2019s wealthiest families gathered here for aperitifs.\n\nSince the war, La Dalia has mostly been a gang-zone dive frequented only by calloused old men. In the last few years, though, the area surrounding Plaza Libertad, just outside La Dalia\u2019s window, has added a decorative fountain and benches. The Libertad movie house has turned on its blue neon Libertad sign, even if the theater\u2019s still closed, and art galleries have sprung up.\n\nThe rest of downtown, however, is largely a crisis area where yellow police tape is common and chain-link fences surround both seedy parking lots and opulent but abandoned stone buildings with Doric-columned facades. The rickety open-air sidewalk bodegas have corrugated metal roofs and crude signs Magic Markered on cardboard.\n\nRight now, on a Saturday night at La Dalia, a 20-something fellow in a crisp pork pie hat is chalking his cue stick. I meet a few painters, then a sculptor. I talk to a muscled photographer so exuberant about his tattoos that he strips off his shirt to show me his shoulder tat of a shimmering, silver \u201950s-era microphone. \u201cFreedom of speech,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nBus passengers in Soyapango, a suburb of San Salvador. (Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post)\n\nAs I mill through the crowd, I know the prosperity I\u2019m seeing here might not last. In his isolationist fervor, President Trump is ending temporary protected status, a humanitarian program that has facilitated U.S. residency for war-scarred Salvadorans since 2001. The remittances that U.S.-based Salvadorans send home constitute 20 percent of their nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nEventually I find myself standing behind a slight and boyish young man dressed in black jeans and a black T-shirt wrapped, androgynously, in a black mesh singlet. He keeps shifting yogi-like in his chair, so that now he is sitting cross-legged and now he is kneeling on his haunches as he peers, oblivious to all others, into the cracked screen of his iPad. He has a wispy beard. Beside his beer glass is a formidable English-language volume, \u201cErotism: Death and Sensuality,\u201d by Georges Bataille.\n\nAsking around, I find that the man goes by a nom de plume, Nadie, which is Spanish for \u201cnobody.\u201d He\u2019s a poet and a visual artist, and he grew up \u2014 and still lives \u2014 in Soyapango, a San Salvador suburb, population 275,000, that is, with San Salvador, one of El Salvador\u2019s perennially most violent cities. When I meet an American curator, Caroline Lacey, she draws me aside. \u201cNadie,\u201d she says, \u201cis the most interesting artist in El Salvador.\u201d\n\nWhen I approach Nadie, he is gentle and welcoming. He can\u2019t hear me over the music, though, even as he leans toward me. It\u2019s simply too loud, so he scribbles his phone number into my notebook and, beside that, he draws a small, squiggly heart.\n\nBefore I meet with Nadie the next day, I do some research. His real name is Javier Ramirez. He is 32. He has a drag queen alter ego, Nadia. He is 5-foot-5 barefoot and, he will tell me with a wry lilt, six inches taller in heels.\n\nNadie\u2019s work is conceptual, and at times it involves satirical pranks. Once, when the august tastemakers at the Museo de Arte de El Salvador (MARTE) offered him a solo show, he didn\u2019t display his own work. Rather, he thumbed his nose at the museum\u2019s brass \u2014 \u201call elites,\u201d in his sour opinion \u2014 and hung naive paintings of flowers wrought by his father, a mid-level bank functionary.\n\nAnother, more earnestly curated show now hangs at MARTE. \u201cWhere There Was Fire,\u201d on display until 2022, presents work by 24 of El Salvador\u2019s best contemporary artists and includes a three-minute video by Nadie titled \u201cIt\u2019s the cumbia that rules my country.\u201d The film purports to celebrate a danceable folk music, but as it delivers cheesy shots of purple-clad trumpeters swaying in unison, it\u2019s brutally spliced with images from El Salvador\u2019s war: a burning bus, snipers, a medley of corpses. When we reach the third corpse, a soldier in combat boots, Nadie lingers on the body for a full four seconds as the upbeat soundtrack goes silent. We know, watching, that it\u2019s more than the cumbia that rules Nadie\u2019s country. But what exactly is this guy saying about El Salvador?\n\n\u201cI ride the bus every day,\u201d Nadie tells me when we meet, \u201cand on the bus I constantly see people getting mugged. Meanwhile, all the drivers like to play pop music really loud. You could be getting killed, and the soundtrack to your murder is Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018Girls Just Want to Have Fun.\u2019 This is a f---ed up place. It\u2019s hilarious.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re in a wealthy neighborhood, Nadie and I, in a swank brewpub, Cadejo, a few blocks from MARTE. His black clothes are rumpled now, and his manner is droll \u2014 Andy Warhol with a tincture of sweetness. He tells me that in El Salvador violence laces every moment with tension. \u201cIn Soyapango,\u201d he says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the curb waiting for the bus, the drivers will drive directly up to you, acting like they\u2019re going to run you over. Then at the last minute they swerve and then laugh like, \u2018Hey, that was nothing!\u2019 A few months ago, I decided I was going to wear all white, but just as I was leaving my house, a bus came along. On purpose, the driver billowed smoke all over my clothes.\u201d\n\nSim\u00f3n Vega\u2019s artwork.

(Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Soyapango,\u201d he says, shrugging, \u201cand I\u2019m a drag queen. The life expectancy for gender-nonconforming people in El Salvador is 35. I\u2019m 32.\u201d\n\nNow, the brewpub\u2019s stereo pipes up, so that we\u2019re drowning in a corny English-language version of \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d A well-dressed dining party nearby titters as they circle about a single candle. Nadie waits, impassive, until the song plays itself out, and meanwhile I notice that this brewpub, unlike its stateside counterparts, doesn\u2019t strive for an antique cobbler-bench vibe. No, Cadejo is decidedly Vegas, with shiny plastic patio chairs and bright, stagy lighting.\n\n\u201cEl Salvador is a cheesy country,\u201d Nadie says. \u201cEveryone here is just pretending. You have to do that to survive in a screwed-up society, but I\u2019m interested in art that disrupts things, that provokes.\u201d He tells me about a new project. He\u2019s writing poems that explore the animal-like cruelty that drove a particularly brutal, U.S.-trained unit of the Salvadoran army, the Atlacatl Battalion, during the civil war. He plans to read the poems theatrically as a blurry backdrop video shows a mutant, two-legged cow hobbling about on its hoofs. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the art is ugly,\u201d he tells me. \u201cWhat matters is that it captures reality.\u201d\n\nGingerly, I tell him that I\u2019m touring Trump\u2019s most hated countries looking for beauty. All sweetness drains from his voice. \u201cI\u2019m against beauty,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what beauty is beyond pretty flowers, beyond the superficial.\u201d He tells me that for five years, with a friend, he ran a local arts festival that he called Fiesta Ecl\u00e9ctica de las Artes, so that the acronym would be FEA. \u201cFea\u201d means \u201cugly\u201d in Spanish.\n\nOne afternoon I go to what\u2019s called a performance piece at MARTE. A San Salvador arts collective, the Fire Theory, has brought into the museum a civil rights lawyer to convene with two soft-spoken older country women in a gallery space, where they\u2019ll discuss a real-life legal case involving their relatives, whom the Salvadoran military made disappear decades ago during the civil war. The \u201cart\u201d on display is the meeting.\n\nThe Fire Theory\u2019s Melissa Guevara, who helped coordinate the show, says of the women, \u201cThese people are treated like animals. We need the media to pay attention. We need the government to do something.\u201d But almost no one turns up to watch. And I\u2019m reminded anew that, even now, 27 years into peacetime, El Salvador is still a polarized country.\n\nI seek out Sim\u00f3n Vega, who, at 46, is El Salvador\u2019s most well-traveled artist, having shown his sculptures in Italy, Austria, Cuba, Dallas and at Coachella, the California music festival. Vega\u2019s work is at once larksome and deep. He makes spaceships \u2014 funky, fantastical, nonflying vehicles imbued with both the sleek glimmer of actual rockets and the ragged disorder of a street vendor\u2019s stall. His installation \u201cThird World Space Explorers,\u201d now showing at MARTE, looks at first like a homeless encampment dumped mid-gallery. There are two wheeled carts and, beneath one, a massive, mysterious lump that is the size of a truck tire and wrapped in a wrinkled blue tarp. The carts are appointed with all kinds of jury-rigged shelves, and weird, junky gadgetry is affixed to them: a mirror, a Rubik\u2019s Cube, segments of garden hose.\n\nWhen I travel 45 minutes south of San Salvador to meet Vega at his home by the Pacific Ocean one evening, he talks first about the Cold War and how it brought carnage to the streets of his childhood. \u201cI wanted to do work about that time in El Salvador, about the Cold War, without being too literal,\u201d he tells me.\n\nEventually, he began thinking about the space race between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. His meditations made him feel a little inferior. \u201cWe\u2019re not good at technology in El Salvador,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t make things perfect and shiny. We\u2019re sort of broken. We\u2019re seeking an identity.\u201d\n\nA few years ago, Vega began looking for the Salvadoran soul. Working as a sort of anthropologist, he traveled Latin America with a camera, making comparisons of how, say, Mexican and Salvadoran street vendors racked bags of potato chips. \u201cWe\u2019re messier,\u201d Vega tells me. \u201cWe\u2019re living a life that can end at any moment, so we don\u2019t organize. We just throw stuff down and get going.\u201d\n\nFor many, El Salvador\u2019s chaos might be a negative. Vega has embraced it. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a different kind of technology here, a different kind of beauty,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you look at our shantytowns, there\u2019s an ingenuousness in the way people make do with cardboard, with scraps of metal. There\u2019s color to it. There\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nArtist Nadie on the banks of Las Ca\u00f1as River in Apopa, El Salvador. \u201cApart from the violence,\u201d Nadie says, \u201ceveryday life here is very mundane.\u201d (Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post) Salvadoran artist Sim\u00f3n Vega in La Libertad. \u201cWe don\u2019t make things perfect and shiny,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of broken.

We\u2019re seeking an identity.\u201d (Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post)\n\nI persuade Nadie to take me on a tour of Soyapango, which lies a half-hour east of San Salvador. Caroline Lacey, the American curator, drives us, and Nadie turns the trip into a vocabulary lesson, teaching me an adjective endemic to El Salvador. \u201cGrencho\u201d can mean \u201ccheesy\u201d or \u201ckitsch,\u201d but it also nods, Nadie tells me, to the darkness underlying El Salvador\u2019s good cheer. Nadie regards nearly everything in his orbit as grencho. The cumbia is grencho, as is his dad\u2019s artwork, and Salvadorans\u2019 ardor for toy guns.\n\n\u201cIn one way,\u201d he continues, \u201cI don\u2019t like things that are grencho. In another way, I\u2019m obsessed.\u201d As we pull into the streets of Soyapango, past swarms of small schoolchildren laden with backpacks, he seems grencho himself, sentimental. \u201cApart from the violence,\u201d Nadie says, \u201ceveryday life here is very mundane. I\u2019ve never seen an empty street. People use the public space in a very normal way, selling bread and fruit in the street, playing soccer, eating pupusas. It might not look like an advertisement, with people walking their dogs and smiling fake smiles, but there is happiness here. There is joy.\u201d\n\nNadie still lives in his childhood home, along with his dad, and he tells me, \u201cAll I do here is sleep and make art. I go into San Salvador every day.\u201d He and Lacey are poised to open an art sales space \u2014 the Only Gallery \u2014 downtown next month. But even as he claims that Soyapango is unimportant to him, he\u2019s protective of the place. He won\u2019t let me inside his house, for fear I\u2019ll be judgmental, and when he talks about the Barrio 18 gangster who lives five houses down, his tone becomes fond. \u201cHe\u2019s very nice to me,\u201d he says. \u201cHe always asks how my day\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in discussing his life as a Salvadoran artist, Nadie told me, \u201cI feel very privileged that I get to do what I do \u2014 and that I live here. I can be myself more here than I could anywhere else. I never want to move.\u201d The human mind, it seems, wants to believe in the safety of home.\n\nSonia Isabel Aguilar dances in downtown San Salvador. (Fred Ramos/For The Washington Post)\n\nIn El Salvador, the mental gyrations that citizens must go through just to fall asleep can be extreme, and Nadie\u2019s cumbia video explores these gyrations. It lampoons Salvadorans\u2019 grencho wishful thinking amid darkness, and also revels in it. His work isn\u2019t going to save El Salvador, of course, but it might help Salvadorans know they are possessed of a strange, unique hope \u2014 one that is there every moment if you just look for it.\n\nAs we turn back onto the highway, Nadie lets up on his boycott of beauty and says, \u201cThere are certain things in Soyapango I think are beautiful, like when the streetlights come on at dusk \u2014 very grencho, I know \u2014 and once I remember this crazy street lady came up to me in the driving rain and asked me to help her lift a manhole cover, to rescue a cat that had gotten down into the sewer pipes. This woman lives on my street, and I think she\u2019s homeless. She makes money throwing away other people\u2019s garbage. I\u2019d never talked to her before, but now she was afraid the cat would drown, and so we tried to lift the lid off the manhole. We tried, but it was impossible. The cat died.\u201d\n\nOn his iPad, Nadie shows me a picture of the woman kneeling on the wet pavement, her head pressed against a sewer grate as, desperately, she peers downward. \u201cShe acted like that cat was her child,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cSo what was so beautiful to you?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cJust that the woman cared so much,\u201d Nadie says. \u201cI come from a very stigmatized place, but the stigma does not define who we are. Everyday life goes on here \u2014 very human experiences. Here was this crazy old lady out in the rain in Soyapango, and still there was something she loved.\u201d\n\nMusicians and fans gather at Code 146 in Monrovia, Liberia. The club is adorned with a mural depicting African and African American luminaries. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) III. LiBeRIa\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nHaiti, El Salvador and Africa: There are 54 countries in Africa. Which ones was Trump thinking of when he spoke of the \u201cshithole countries\u201d? Considering the shameful role the United States has played in Haiti\u2019s and El Salvador\u2019s histories, I suppose I could have gone to Rwanda, where in 1994 the United States did not intervene to stop a genocide resulting in the deaths of roughly 1 million Rwandans. But Rwanda is now a magnet for safari tourists who want to see gorillas and coffee plantations. It has risen out of chaos.\n\nWhat about Nigeria? In 2017, Trump groused that if emigres from that country were granted visas, they would never \u201cgo back to their huts.\u201d But Nigeria is home to Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nIn the end, I decided Liberia was a reliable stand-in as Trump\u2019s target. The country was founded in 1822 by white Americans who wanted to remove once-enslaved slaves from the United States, and today Liberia is among the world\u2019s 15 poorest nations. Its average citizen lives on less than $2 a day, and like El Salvador, it is poised to suffer from Trump\u2019s immigration policies. In March 2018, the president decreed that the 800-plus Liberians staying in the United States with temporary protected status will need to return to their native land within a year \u2014 that is, by this March 31.\n\nWhen I land in Liberia\u2019s capital city, Monrovia, it\u2019s a sweltering Friday night in November, and soon I\u2019m picking my way down an unlit alley. Then I step into a dimly lit nightclub and hear my name: \u201cBill! My boy Bill!\u201d A rapper named Henry \u201cAmaze\u201d Toe is here to meet me following our long Facebook dialogue. His Afro is stylishly bleached, his earrings golden, his jeans artfully torn. \u201cWhat\u2019s popping, Bill?\u201d Amaze says. He stands, then throws his arms skyward for an embrace.\n\nI have arrived at Code 146, which means I am standing in the epicenter of the HipCo universe. HipCo is a local version of hip-hop, and I\u2019m tuning into it because, really, HipCo is to Liberia as jazz is to the United States: It is an art form indigenous to this tiny nation. It is a new music that gives voice to the Liberian masses, and it is central to Liberia\u2019s hope to transcend its long status as an American satellite. C. Patrick Burrowes, arguably the nation\u2019s foremost historian, will tell me, \u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of a renaissance, and HipCo is at the leading edge of it.\u201d\n\nHipCo sees the disenfranchised speaking truth to one another \u2014 in their own language, no less. The \u201cco\u201d in HipCo is short for \u201cKolokwa,\u201d which is the dialect that the Liberian underclass has been improvising since the early 19th century, blending the English brought by 19,000 ex-slaves with words from about 15 native tongues to attain a soft-sounding patois. Kolokwa is 99 percent an oral language \u2014 as yet, there is not a single full book in the dialect \u2014 and it is all but incomprehensible to the American ear. In Liberia, the cultural elite have long shunned it as lowbrow. Which means that when HipCo artists inject a few choice snatches of Kolokwa into otherwise English lyrics, their words have political zing.\n\nThe most political \u2014 and the most famous \u2014 HipCo singer is Code 146\u2019s 37-year-old owner. Jonathan Koffa was so central to the mid-2000s Monrovia-based genesis of HipCo that he became known as Takun J, the name being a Kolokwa take on Tycoon. In 2015, he wrote a sort of anthem, \u201cThey Lie to Us,\u201d that I listened to repeatedly on the plane. \u201cI sayayaaa,\u201d Takun cries out in that song, stretching his words. \u201cThey lie. Lay pepoh fool us oh. Lay pepoh lie to us.\u201d Right now, as the crowd swells for a Friday-night open mic, Takun is surrounded by an entourage and sucking meditatively on a large reefer as he eyes the stage. The show begins around 10, and it stars a medley of rappers. Amaze takes the stage to rip through a frenetic, muscular 10-minute set featuring a tightly written rap about a corrupt teacher who takes \u201ckini kini\u201d (small change) to keep \u201cwackin\u2019 it\u201d (eating, that is). After rapper Lady Skeet performs, fans surge toward her, showering her with money until the air above the stage is a blizzard of Liberian five-dollar bills, each one worth about 3 U.S. cents.\n\nBut all this is prelude to the moment Takun J stands before us, lean and dreadlocked and delicately featured, glimmering with sweat as he bends low to switch on the bright blue LEDs lining the sidewalls of his super sneakers. He gives a disjointed and, to me at least, inaudibly fuzzy sermon about love. Then he rolls into a magical medley: a cover of Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cOne Love\u201d segueing, eventually, to \u201cThey Lie.\u201d His long braids whip behind him, dappled in the glow of the disco lights. The money rains thick on the stage.\n\nHipCo artist Henry \u201cAmaze\u201d Toe performs. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nMy hotel sits just a few blocks from Code 146 in Central Monrovia, the city\u2019s weary seaside old town. The hilly streets around me are choked with little yellow three-wheeled shared taxis \u2014 keh kehs, they\u2019re called \u2014 and when stray preschoolers, wandering about sans guardians, need to cross the busy streets they reach up to clasp the guiding hands of strangers. One afternoon I find myself shepherding five tiny children through the mayhem.\n\nWhile there are many formal stores in Central Monrovia, the commercial life of the city lies on the sidewalks, where some vendors push wheelbarrows filled with socks as others line the pavement with shoes. I gather my breakfast each morning by wandering between vendors, buying fresh bread (12 cents U.S.), a couple of boiled eggs (12 cents) and then a few slices of fresh pineapple and coconut before repairing to Broad Street, where small clumps of men gather at newsstands to peruse newspapers pinned on high clotheslines.\n\nTakun grew up largely in wartime refugee camps. In his teens, though, he sat on the sidewalks of Central Monrovia, making a slim margin distributing Liberian currency in exchange for American bills. His club is proof that he stayed loyal to his neighborhood. Code 146, which bears no exterior signs, is more community center than business. He lives upstairs with his two children and the children\u2019s mother, Sugar. When I drop by, seeking to float Takun into a long, soul-searching chat, he is playing soccer on his PlayStation, the furrow on his brow so etched that it practically shouts, \u201cdo not disturb.\u201d He is wearing headphones and staring off into space, so that I cannot reach him.\n\nBut Takun is not the only player in Kolokwa\u2019s glory moment. HipCo has inspired Liberian writers and poets to see the potency in an underlooked street tongue, and one morning I meet with the dean of literary Kolokwa. D. Othniel Forte is a publisher. His eponymous press, Forte Publishing, will this summer release a book written in Kolokwa. \u201cKuku Jumu Ku,\u201d an anthology whose title means \u201cinsider\u2019s club,\u201d will feature Liberian women writing about their nation, postwar. Along with many of \u201cKuku Jumu Ku\u2019s\u201d authors, Forte is also at work on a Kolokwa dictionary. \u201cWe have a private Facebook group,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere are eight people, and we\u2019re working word by word to come up with standardized definitions and spellings. We want to gather 4,000 words. Right now we\u2019re at 200.\u201d\n\nThe journey, Forte says, is all about word music. It\u2019s about trying to render an unwritten language in letters. Kolokwa goes easy on hard consonants, he tells me, and it carries its own idioms, so that the phrase \u201cWe\u2019re insaaah\u201d doesn\u2019t mean, \u201cWe\u2019re inside the building,\u201d but rather, \u201cWe\u2019re committed to the struggle.\u201d Elision is paramount (\u201cCome, let\u2019s go\u201d is \u201ccomelego\u201d in Kolokwa), but so is elongation. \u201cIf you\u2019re really insaaa,\u201d Forte explains patiently, \u201cyou\u2019re insaaaaaa.\u201d\n\nIf the Kolokwa revolution is to go forward, it will need Forte. It will need both his precise mind and Takun\u2019s spirit. Liberia\u2019s problems are deep, after all, and for language and song to triumph over despair, the assault must be multipronged. \u201cKolokwa is as rich a language as French,\u201d Forte tells me, \u201cand if you want to bring about social change, it\u2019s the language you need to use.\u201d A few years ago, he asked himself, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start writing it?\u201d\n\nForte, who\u2019s 41, didn\u2019t grow up speaking Kolokwa \u2014 his father, a Methodist minister, saw the language as plebeian \u2014 and for most of his adult life he\u2019s lived outside of Liberia. He left Monrovia in 1992 to teach English in a succession of Asian cities. But far from home, Kolokwa tugged on his heartstrings. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing that Liberians have in common when they sit down to the table,\u201d he says.\n\nFans dance and cheer at a HipCo concert in Monrovia.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post) Fans dance at a HipCo concert in Monrovia. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nForte moved back to Liberia in 2017, when he felt the nation had attained enough tranquility, postwar, to sprout an indigenous literature. (\u201cYou can\u2019t write when the bullets are still flying,\u201d he explains.) He is still so newly arrived that Liberian food, often spicy, upsets his stomach. Still, his Kolokwa dreams are vast. He believes that, in standardized Kolokwa, Liberians can find a \u201cnational identity, something to rally around,\u201d and he envisions a day when Liberians of all classes can turn to a standardized Kolokwa for stories, both true and fictional, about their nation\u2019s most pressing issues. \u201cWe can have podcasts in Kolokwa,\u201d he envisions, \u201cand the words will flash across the screens of people\u2019s smartphones. We can do subtitles on TV programs.\u201d\n\nListening to Forte, I feel almost lifted. His optimism is that stirring, but still his tone \u2014 erudite, almost professorial \u2014 seems out of sync with a language that lives most in the mouths of the dispossessed. How can a guy like this bridge the class gap?\n\nForte is well aware of this challenge. \u201cWe aim to get HipCo musicians like Takun J on board. That\u2019s important,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re already part of a movement, and we want to approach them and say, \u2018Why not work with us? Would you take these stories we\u2019ve written and work them into your songs?\u2019 \u201d I ask Forte if he\u2019s ever been to Code 146. He hasn\u2019t, but he makes plans to meet me there in a few days.\n\nOne morning I join Amaze and Lady Skeet to take in a new spot on the HipCo landscape. The Innovation Campus, perched on a hill at the western edge of Central Monrovia, is the pleasant half-acre Liberian home of the Accountability Lab, a Washington-based nongovernmental organization that aims to give young people in poor countries \u2014 among them Liberia, Nepal and Pakistan \u2014 a creative voice, so they can hold leaders\u2019 feet to the fire. Funded in part by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the iCampus is home to killer WiFi, a filmmaking studio that produces a TV show called \u201cIntegrity Idol\u201d and \u2014 to Amaze\u2019s delight \u2014 a $12,000 recording studio.\n\nAs a celebrated Liberian sound man sits at the mixing board, Amaze and Lady Skeet lean against the foam-covered walls, teaching me Kolokwa words that they believe have emerged only in recent months.\n\n\u201cShekie dada,\u201d says Lady Skeet. \u201cThat\u2019s someone who has a lot of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cKwass,\u201d says Amaze, who is, officially speaking, the Lab\u2019s Liberian accountability ambassador, its liaison to the local music community. \u201cHiding the money. Embezzling it. He kwass the Central Bank money and\u201d \u2014 Amaze gestures daintily toward an imaginary secret compartment in his blue jeans \u2014 \u201che put it in his wise pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cZwag,\u201d says Lady Skeet. \u201cThat\u2019s eating corruption money.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of girls. Fast cars,\u201d Amaze explains before getting serious. \u201cIntegrity is a great issue in our society,\u201d he says, \u201cat every level. We have market women putting candle wax in their measurement cups to shorten your ration of rice.\u201d\n\nWhen I\u2019m hungry, I decide to veer away from the market, and one night I find a street-corner food stand that serves delectable fish, still on the bone and still fish-shaped, and I eat, along with other diners, on a little wood bench by the vendor\u2019s grill.\n\nA man carries a bag full of coconuts ashore from a boat in Buchanan, Liberia.

(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next day, I go swimming in the rough surf off Golden Beach, testing fate a little as a large sign warns of riptides. After I stand and scramble out of the water, I\u2019m running late for an interview. I\u2019m in a hurry on busy Tubman Boulevard, and my guard is down. When a driver pulls up in a battered Toyota, presenting himself as a cabbie, I make a rookie mistake. I climb in, not quite adding up that all five other passengers are young men.\n\nInside there\u2019s confusion. One guy slams the car door shut over and over. The two guys beside me jostle about, like they\u2019re trying to scrunch us all together in the crowded back seat. Then the driver tells me that he\u2019s not going up Tubman after all.\n\nWhen I step back onto the sidewalk, my iPhone 6 is gone from my pocket. Soon, D. Othniel Forte will tell me the fake taxi trick is so common in Liberia that a local gang has made the scheme its specialty \u2014 Passenger 57, the gang is called. The name recycles the title of a 1992 Wesley Snipes movie about airplane hijackers.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Liberia\u2019s slang is tethered to American culture. Liberia has always been tethered. In the early 1800s, a white-dominated group called the American Colonization Society conceived of a country for freed slaves, which became Liberia. Whites appointed by the ACS governed Liberia for the nation\u2019s first 25 years and named the capital after President James Monroe. In 1980, a 28-year-old barely educated soldier, Samuel Doe, took over Liberia in a violent coup \u2014 and stayed in power largely because he was a reliable Cold War ally for the United States. Doe eschewed the Soviet Union and welcomed the U.S. military to train in Liberia\u2019s ports. In turn, the United States gave Liberia $500 million in aid or loans \u2014 more per capita than any other country in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 between 1980 and 1985. (Nevermind that Doe once had 13 of his political foes executed on a public beach.)\n\nIt was Liberian discontent with Doe that spurred the nation\u2019s first civil war. \u201cEven the way Liberians see themselves has been shaped by the U.S.,\u201d Burrowes, the historian, tells me. \u201cSo far, our scholars haven\u2019t escaped that \u2014 they\u2019ve simply parroted what others have written. How do you escape? HipCo artists are finding a way. They are unapologetically seeing themselves through their own eyes. They\u2019ve found a way to tell their stories.\u201d\n\nOne scorching evening, Forte and I find ourselves on the patio at 146, drinking beer and waiting for Takun. He\u2019s inside at the bar. Ten minutes ago, he promised to come chat about the birthing of written Kolokwa. A few days earlier, though, he spoke skeptically of Forte, suggesting that he\u2019d taken too long to solicit the HipCo community for input on the dictionary. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who got all this started,\u201d he said.\n\nForte and I are facing a mural Takun commissioned. Labeled \u201cLegends Never Die,\u201d it features a pantheon of black heroes: Nelson Mandela, Haile Selassie, Malcolm X and Takun himself. \u201cWhy are there no women up there?\u201d Forte asks. \u201cIs he going to put women on the opposite wall?\u201d\n\nWe wait. I want this meeting between Takun and Forte to come together. I want Kolokwa force to gather and grow seamlessly, without a hitch, as it propels Liberia toward a bright future. But this may be too much to wish for. Every moment here is complicated by history, and perhaps all you can hope for in Liberia is that hope stays alive. Forte does not despair. After maybe 45 minutes, his tone softens. \u201cI\u2019ll come talk to Takun when it\u2019s less busy,\u201d he says. \u201cI need to do that. We need to understand one another.\u201d\n\nWhen we amble back inside, passing the bar en route to the exit, Takun sees us and bathes us in his celebrity smile. Just the way he stands there glowing \u2014 there\u2019s a performer\u2019s grace to it, a nimbleness that lowly, unassuming writers like Forte and me can\u2019t even touch.\n\nTakun hugs Forte. He sounds a couple of glancing positive remarks about Forte\u2019s Kolokwa endeavors \u2014 \u201cI like it; let\u2019s work together\u201d \u2014 and then Forte and I float out through the alley, our feet pattering in the puddles. \u201cI\u2019m feeling so hopeful,\u201d Forte says, foreseeing a collaboration with Takun. \u201cI cannot afford to be anything but optimistic.\u201d\n\nA singer performs at an open-mic night at Code 146 in Monrovia. (Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen I land in New York, it\u2019s early morning. I flick on my backup phone, and then I decide to dive headlong into American reality. I navigate to @realDonaldTrump on Twitter. The first tweet I encounter reads, \u201cThe White House is running very smoothly. ... We are the envy of the world.\u201d\n\nI wonder how far I have really traveled from the viper\u2019s den of Liberian politics. As I head down the long corridors of the airport, I find myself humming the Takun J tune \u201cThey Lie.\u201d \u201cI sayayaaa, they lie. They can lie. They can steal. They can connive.\u201d\n\nI think, too, of something that Burrowes said about HipCo artists: \u201cWith no resources save for their talent, they\u2019ve created something out of nothing.\u201d Couldn\u2019t this be said of every person I met on my trips \u2014 of the HipCo pioneers, and the chefs in Haiti, and the sculptors and filmmakers and painters in El Salvador?\n\nThe president reviled all of these people with one ugly phrase, and they refused to be defamed. Instead, they speak. They create. How can I not be inspired? I feel hallowed, really, to have connected, all over the globe, with artists working in difficult straits. And as I step into the long line at immigration control, I\u2019m resolved to keep these connections alive. Even if we never step outside the States, aren\u2019t we obliged to stay open to the possibilities offered us by all peoples, all cultures?\n\nThe line snakes between the crowd-control stanchions. The low din of the multitudes fills the high-ceilinged hall. Eventually the customs officer summons me to the window and flips open my passport to give me the once-over. He compares the photo against the weary traveler standing before him. Then I hear the hard chonk of his rubber stamp hitting my passport. Outside the sun is climbing in the sky. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d he says.\n\nBill Donahue is a frequent contributor to the magazine. He lives in New Hampshire.\n\nCredits: Story by Bill Donahue.

Visit rainbownetwork.org if you\u2019d like to be a part of The Rainbow Network\u2019s work feeding and providing relief in rural Nicaragua. There you can find information on how to donate money, time or travel to the organization.\n\nAccording to a press release, the 40 millionth meal was served on April 24, just days after the region was hit by destructive earthquakes. But even natural disasters won\u2019t keep this organization from feeding the people who need it the most, and at least 800 people attended the 40 millionth meal event. Even Nicaraguan government officials came to celebrate.\n\nIn addition to providing meals, The Rainbow Network works to create a sustainable, community-based effort in rural Nicaragua and has been able to reduce its feeding centers from 220 to 132 thanks to the organization\u2019s family garden and micro-loan programs that help people become self-reliant. More then 9,000 people are served daily by the feeding centers\u2014and it all started with the dedication of some 417-land do-gooders.\n\nKids from the Nagarote municipality of Nicaragua enjoyed lunch as they celebrated the 40 millionth meal served by The Rainbow Network."}, {"title": "VIDEO: Alerta roja por un sismo de magnitud 6,2 que sacudi\u00f3 Nicaragua", "url": "https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/view/124928-sismo-terremoto-sacudir-nicaragua", "content": "#Avance Un sismo de magnitud 6,4 sacude Nicaragua Foto supermercado en Managua pic.twitter.com/Ro3nNcpbJw \u2014 Noticia al Dia (@Pregonero_Sagaz) April 11, 2014\n\n#Temblor#Nicaragua da\u00f1os en estructuras ante movimiento s\u00edsmicos con epicentro en el Lago de #Managuapic.twitter.com/tDSPkPnq7C \u2014 Jessica Meza (@Ysikmeza) April 11, 2014\n\nEl presidente Daniel Ortega confirm\u00f3 la muerte de una persona y decret\u00f3 la alerta roja tras el terremoto en el que al menos 24 personas m\u00e1s resultaron heridas y 139 viviendas fueron destruidas, seg\u00fan confirm\u00f3 Guillermo Gonz\u00e1lez, director del Sistema Nacional de Prevenci\u00f3n, Atenci\u00f3n y Mitigaci\u00f3n de Desastres (SINAPRED).El epicentro del terremoto se localiz\u00f3 a una profundidad de 5 kil\u00f3metros en el Lago de Nicaragua, a 22.5 kil\u00f3metros al noreste de la ciudad de Nagarote.Se reporta que el temblor se sinti\u00f3 en San Salvador y en la zona oriental colindante con Honduras.

Subscribe today to receive it !\n\nAre social conditions in Ecuador beginning to deteriorate? A report released in June 2018 on poverty and inequality by Ecuador\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Census found that poverty crept up slightly between June 2017 and June 2018, with 24.5 percent of the population living in poverty, up from 23.1 percent the year before. While these numbers may appear low, they could be a sign of things to come as the Ecuadorian government under Len\u00edn Moreno doubles down on economic policies favoring austerity and deregulation while attempting to discredit the Left. The political and economic prognosis appeared quite different when Moreno was elected in April 2017, representing the center-left ruling party, Alianza Pa\u00eds (Country Alliance), narrowly defeating neoliberal banker Guillermo Lasso. The Latin American left, against the backdrop of a resurgent Right turn, was relieved: onlookers expected Moreno to continue the progressive advances his predecessor, Rafael Correa, had made during his tenure in office under the Citizens\u2019 Revolution, with perhaps a softer edge. But once in office, Moreno swiftly pivoted on his campaign promises, governing with a right-wing neoliberal agenda that has already chipped away at the gains of the Citizens\u2019 Revolution and could threaten to bury it entirely. Alianza Pa\u00eds is now split. Moreno, who served as Correa\u2019s vice president from 2007 to 2013, has changed the party leadership and its priorities. Correa and his supporters left the party in January 2018 and have not been allowed to form their own party structures since. Meanwhile, under Moreno\u2019s leadership, Alianza Pa\u00eds has lost much of its previous support. Since his inauguration, Moreno has claimed his government inherited an economic and institutional crisis, presenting neoliberal adjustment policies and austerity as the solution. In the process, Moreno and his allies have lambasted Correa-era infrastructure projects as examples of government corruption and mismanagement as well as cornerstone education and technology projects, such as the innovation hub known as Yachay City of Knowledge. He also cautioned that the recently refurbished oil refinery in Esmeraldas was severely damaged \u2014 its scheduled temporary shutdown was postponed repeatedly until it was finally enacted in March 2019. Moreno has claimed that Correa installed a camera in the presidential palace to monitor his every move. The new authorities also tried to put Correa on trial on numerous occasions in a clear attempt of political persecution. One of the attempts was to put Correa on trial for kidnapping without noteworthy evidence. Interpol failed to issue a red alert notice citing human rights. Far from a personal feud between two leading politicians, less than two years into his term in office Moreno has proven that, despite being elected as a candidate of the Left, his government is executing a right-wing agenda.\n\nThe Citizens\u2019 Revolution The Citizens\u2019 Revolution, led by Rafael Correa from 2007 to 2017, followed a period of high instability and dissatisfaction with the neoliberal development model. Influential and politically well-connected business groups were able to negotiate special regulations and capture rents through cartels and monopolies. Between 1996 and 2006, no elected president had been able to complete his term of office. In the late 1990s, Ecuador slid into a severe crisis following financial deregulation. Economic output plummeted and the state shelled out billions to rescue the banks. Then-President Jamil Mahuad, whose government had close ties with the financial sector, was eventually overthrown in a popular uprising in early 2000, shortly after announcing the country\u2019s official dollarization. Even before the crisis, inequality had increased massively. In the period between 1999 and 2005, hundreds of thousands of Ecuadorians left the country, mainly to Spain and the United States. The remittances they sent home, along with rising oil revenues, were essential to economic recovery. However, while economic crisis eased, political instability continued. In 2005, the next elected president, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez, was toppled. The slogan \u201cQue se vayan todos\u201d, or \u201cOut with them all,\u201d illustrated that protests took aim at the entire political-economic establishment. Rafael Correa\u2019s election marked a fundamental change in Ecuadorian politics. His Citizens\u2019 Revolution passed one of the world\u2019s most progressive constitutions in 2008, approved by popular vote in 2008. The new constitution marked a clear departure from neoliberalism by enshrining the principle of good living, or buen vivir in Spanish or sumak kawsay in Quechua, and emphasized social and cultural rights, a stronger role of the state, and socially and environmentally sustainable development. Given the dissatisfaction with the established party system and its ties to business elites, Correa\u2019s actions to limit the influence of the special interest groups were highly popular. His approval rating was close to 74 percent in 2007 and only dropped below 50 percent in 2016, according to Latinobarometro. The Correa government owed much of its popularity to its massive investments in public infrastructure, roads, hydroelectric power plants, schools, health centers, and other projects. In order to reduce reliance on volatile oil revenues, the government spearheaded a fight against tax evasion and avoidance, leading to significant increases in fiscal revenues including social security from 12.7 percent in 2006 to 20.5 percent in 2015. Oil revenues were no longer invested abroad for low returns at home, but used to strengthen social and economic infrastructure in Ecuador. Many of these investments help to stabilize today\u2019s foreign trade balance. Ecuador\u2019s per capita economic growth averaged 1.5 percent between 2006 and 2016, well above the growth rate of 0.6 percent from 1980 to 2006. The proportion of residents with unmet basic needs fell from 52 percent in 2006 to less than 36 percent in 2014. However, the government faced criticism for pushing through an extractivist agenda and not going far enough to put the rights of nature enshrined in the constitution into practice. The government\u2019s relations to social movements and trade unions were fraught. Social movements opposed Correa\u2019s rejection of a rapid transition from extractivism, which has long been a cornerstone of Ecuador\u2019s economy. At the same time, some of the better-organized trade unions and social movement organizations that had gained niches of influence in the government before the Citizens\u2019 Revolution, found themselves shut out of political decision-making under the Correa government. When Correa began to push through an anti-corporatist agenda, the most affected groups were elite representatives, but trade unions and social movements lost presence within the state apparatus as well. In response, these groups started to oppose the government. Beyond that, the Correa government\u2019s confrontational style fueled conflicts with social movements. Government attempts to withdraw legal status from the environmentalist NGO Acci\u00f3n Ecol\u00f3gica certainly contributed to the narrative of an authoritarian government as well as government attempts to ouster the Indigenous CONAIE federation from its head office in Quito, allegedly due to continued violations of the legal terms of usage. While the Correa government denounced violence by anti-government groups, Indigenous and environmentalist movements saw government support for extractivism as the root cause for violence. Though in some cases these movements charged Correa with not going far enough, most saw his party as more supportive of the rights of nature than other parties, owing in part to social movements\u2019 initial support for Moreno. The Citizens\u2019 Revolution entered a difficult period in 2014, in part due to the crash in oil prices. Oil exports plummetedfrom about $13 billion in 2014 to little more than $5 billion in 2016. Total exports fell from $25.8 billion to just $16.8 billion. A devastating earthquake in 2016 worsened the situation. Due to dollarization, the government had less recourse for adjusting exchange rates. Credit requirements rose while interest rates for new loans increased. Ecuador\u2019s economic output stagnated in 2015 and fell by 1.2 percent in 2016 according to ECLAC figures. Yet by 2017, the economy was growing again. The Correa government withstood pressures for more radical steps towards austerity that would have deepened the crisis. Instead, it developed creative mechanisms to withstand external shocks and stabilize the economy, for instance by making use of Central Bank loans to the government. Given the severity of the unexpected events and the limited capacity of a dollarized economy to respond, the economic downturn was surprisingly mild and short compared to previous crises. Despite that, Ecuador\u2019s conservative opposition portrayed a supposedly large and unproductive state apparatus as the root cause of an unprecedented economic emergency. Though corruption in large infrastructure projects no doubt played a role, accounts in corporate media are exaggerated.In particular, opponents used the large scale corruption scandals surrounding the state-owned oil company Petroecuador and the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht to emphasize a narrative of a rotten state that begged a radical shift in the country\u2019s development strategy.\n\nElected Left, Governing Right Once elected, Moreno declared that unlike Correa, he would fight corruption and reduce debts. By adopting the right wing\u2019s framing, Moreno gave legitimacy to neoliberal policies and the return of business elites to the highest levers of state power. Net public debt, which is more telling than gross public debt figures, was still relatively low when Moreno took office. In May 2017 it had reached 27.7 percent, up from 12.2 percent in 2009, but still far from the 65.1 percent it had reached in 2000. In early 2018, Moreno gained support for institutional changes through a seven-part referendum, carried out in February 2018 without the approval of the constitutional court and lacking basic conditions of a fair process. Questions on the referendum were politically misleading: for example, it proposed to restrict the territory for additional oil production in Yasun\u00ed National Park from 1030 to 300 hectares. But the state-owned extraction company only planned to drill in 236 hectares of the national park even prior to the referendum, meaning the passage of that section of the referendum meant little in practice. Moreno also proposed to add close to 60,000 hectares to the zone as a way to cull support from environmentally-concerned or progressive citizens, while planning to loosen restrictions to oil extraction and tourism in the buffer zones close to the park. Meanwhile, the government\u2019s attempt to repeal a Capital Gains Law revealed the new administration\u2019s ties with the real estate sector. Without proof, the Moreno administration presented the law as responsible for a downturn in the construction sector. One of the main goals of the referendum, however, was to block Correa\u2019s eventual return to power by banning reelection and to dissolve the Council for Citizen\u2019s Participation and Social Control (CPCCS). The autonomous CPCCS was part of a transparency effort, responsible for appointing authorities to various federal, electoral, and judicial posts. The new government labeled it as too close to Correa and made it responsible for the selection of officials who turned out to be corrupt. Instead of trying to find ways to make it more autonomous, the referendum gave the executive branch alone the right to nominate the members of a new transitional council. The transitional council, CPCCS-T, was granted powers far beyond the constitution, justified as necessary to ffighting corruption. CPCCS-T president Julio C\u00e9sar Trujillo oversaw the ouster of dozens of high-ranking officials in the Justice Department and state regulatory agencies, and appointed interim successors. In August 2018, the CPCCS-T purged the Constitutional Court judges, alleging that their predecessors in the original CPCCS had not acted independently when designating the judges. Although new judges have been selected in a questionable process, Ecuador has been without a Constitutional Court for months. Today, the Moreno government caters to the interests of rent-oriented sectors, whose influence the Correa administration had sought to curb, with some success. Although Moreno initially kept Correa\u2019s economics team mostly intact, he has since replaced the remaining progressive economists with neoliberal ideologues and representatives of private sector interests. Most notably, Moreno appointed Richard Mart\u00ednez, former president of the Ecuadorian Business Committee, as Minister of Finance in May 2018, marking a radical shift to the Right in comparison to Moreno\u2019s first finance minister, Carlos de la Torre. While Mart\u00ednez is Moreno\u2019s third finance minister, he is the first to accept Moreno\u2019s figures on the country\u2019s debt. Moreno\u2019s figure of about $60 billion in public debt is an exaggeration, as it includes liabilities such as fines from international arbitrations that are usually not counted as public debt, as well potential fines that may turn into liabilities in future. Moreno has used the calculation to accuse Correa of surpassing the official limit for public debt, which the Citizens\u2019 Revolution set at 40 percent of GDP, which he used to justify another lawsuit against Correa. This, along with other actions, has undermined investors\u2019 confidence in Ecuador\u2019s ability to service its debt and increased the risk-premium for government bonds in spite of rising oil prices. This has limited the country\u2019s ability to effectively restructure its public debt in a useful way.In February 2019, Ecuador reached a loan agreement with the IMF, alongside additional loans from the World Bank and other financial institutions. Information on their terms and conditions is still limited\u2014but recent massive layoffs in the public sector could provide a first hint. Without winning an election, the economic elites and their representatives have gradually returned to the levers of state power as Moreno has appointed right-wing figures to top offices. After the elected Vice President Jorge Glas was removed from office and imprisoned on corruption chargesbased on shaky evidence, Maria Alejandra Vicu\u00f1a became Moreno\u2019s second vice president. Vicu\u00f1a, a long-term supporter of the Citizens\u2019 Revolution, a former parliamentarian, and a member of the leftist Bolivarian Alfarist Alliance (ABA)\u2014a current within Alianza Pa\u00eds\u2014began to denounce alleged corruption within the Citizens\u2019 Revolution, but was herself forced to step down over corruption allegations. She allegedly compelled her office staff in parliament to contribute a fraction of their salaries to her personal bank account, which she later declared was to benefit the ABA movement. In late 2018, radio broadcaster Otto Sonnenholzner was appointed Moreno\u2019s third vice president. While Vicu\u00f1a, whose leftist background did not inspire confidence in economic elites, had been elected by a narrow margin, Sonnenholzner received the support of Moreno\u2019s Alianza Pa\u00eds and the main right-wing parties. The parliamentary faction of the Citizens\u2019 Revolution loyal to Rafael Correa voted against Sonnenholzner. What\u2019s more, Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s corruption has apparently been used to provide cover for larger scandals, such as thousands of unauthorized bank debts for allegedly contracting insurance policies without clients\u2019 consent or offshore funds allegedly used to furnish Moreno\u2019s apartment in Geneva. The latter was the tip of the iceberg of a much wider scandal of bribes and offshore bank accounts surrounding Moreno. To protect the president, Ecuadorian institutions have so far blocked demands for an investigation of these events. Meanwhile, Moreno\u2019s policymaking has severely affected the state\u2019s capacity to monitor, control, and regulate private economic activities. After the 2018 referendum, the government started to propose and implement neoliberal economic policies more directly\u2014namely through Moreno\u2019s new economic policy, adopted in June 2018. Its measures include liberalizing foreign trade, introducing new tax exemptions, creating tax loopholes, removing barriers to capital flight into tax havens, and implementing austerity measures. The law prohibits the Central Bank from lending to the government, and requires public banks and social security to invest in private bonds and equities.

They are really key, as is the 9, [hooker] Michael Licaah.\n\n\u200b\"If you watch how they play, they move the ball well and they play a little bit of footy on yardage, as well.\"\n\nWhile the Tongans will follow Moses and co to the promised land, Fittler is mindful that the Cedars have to \"stay in the game\" against their powerful opponents.\n\n\"They all come up the middle, their wings come up the middle, and their fullback.\n\n\"They've got some really skilful players. [Tuimoala] Lolohea did some wonderful things against New Zealand.\n\n\"They are obviously big and they can offload the ball.\"\n\nFittler will be expecting Lebanon to show the spirit they displayed against Australia and England in pool play.\n\n\"You can't get disheartened by being run over sometimes. It's physics.\n\n\"They beat New Zealand at a critical stage of the game, with 10 minutes to go they were behind. We need to be able to match that.\"\n\nThe New Zealand TAB have Lebanon at $10 outsiders.\n\nFittler - a former New South Wales and Australian star \u2013 is, however, confident Lebanon have the players to test a Tonga team that has become the talk of the tournament.\n\n\"We believe we can play a game that can upset them, but a bit needs to go right.\n\n\"We've got to stay in the game and not be disheartened.\"\n\nParramatta prop Tim Mannah will be critical to Lebanon getting some good go-forward against a Tongan pack boasting his Eels clubmate Manu Ma'u.\n\nCedars captain Robbie Farah said \"courage and working hard for your mates\" were key part of Lebanese culture.\n\nHe will be urging his side to display those traits as they seek to farewell stalwarts forwards Ray Moujalli, Nick Kassis and the injured Chris Saab in style.\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nTeams for the Christchurch quarterfinal:\n\nTonga: 1-Will Hopoate, 2-Daniel Tupou, 3-Michael Jennings, 4-Konrad Hurrell, 5-David Fusitu'a, 6-Tui Lolohea, 7-Ata Hingano, 8-Andrew Fifita, 9-Sione Katoa, 10-Sio Siua Taukeiaho, 11-Manu Ma'u, 12-Sika Manu (c), 13-Jason Taumalolo.

You can see what it means for them and their family, and I think it's really cool,\" said Johns.\n\nSince their World Cup warm-up in Penrith in 2013, Tonga and Samoa have added to an already intense rivalry, which produced one of the most dramatic finishes the sport has seen in last year's clash won by Samoa on the Gold Coast.\n\nIt prompted the NRL to announce the Pacific fixtures will continue to be televised until at least 2022 as part of a new $925 million TV deal, while one Test will be played on the Sunday before Game 2 of the State of Origin series, starting in 2018.\n\nThe fixture has also proven to be a springboard for rising stars like Jason Taumalolo, Martin Taupau and Semi Radradra who have moved on to play for the Kiwis and Kangaroos.\n\nBut Tonga's coach believes such players should be allowed to return to the Pacific teams if not picked by Tier One nations.\n\nThis year Tuimoala Lolohea, Siosiua Taukeiaho, Will Hopoate and Daniel Tupou expressed an interest in representing Tonga but were denied under the current eligibility rules.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of tinkering that needs to happen to the eligibility rules,\" said Woolf.\n\n\"There's a number of players .. they'd all love to be playing with us. They express that every opportunity they get.\"\n\nAs it stands, every NRL player is allowed one international eligibility change. Last year Lolohea and Taukeiaho played for Tonga then represented the Kiwis on the end-of-year tour to England.\n\nThe only way they can change eligibility again is if they stand down from international football for two years.\n\n\"You throw those four names in our side and not only do they bring class and a lot of confidence but they make the game a really good spectacle for fans,\" Woolf added.\n\nWhile the future of the Pacific Test weekend seems to be secured, poor crowd attendance on the Gold Coast last year has prompted a move to Parramatta where there is a large Pacific Island population.\n\nNew Zealand has also been touted as a venue for the fixture.\n\n\"I would think, with the support that there would be in New Zealand, that it would be a great success,\" Woolf said. \"I'd love to see it but unfortunately I don't get to make those calls.\"\n\nAn NRL spokesperson said they are 'always looking to have discussions with governments and cities around events including the Pacific Double Header.'\n\nTonga: 1.

(Xinhua via AP)\n\nHONG KONG--Mangkhut weakened from a typhoon to a tropical storm as it moved deeper into southern China on Monday, leaving death and destruction from Hong Kong to the Philippines.\n\nThe storm was still affecting southern China's coast and the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan and rain and strong winds were expected to continue through Tuesday.\n\nHong Kong residents were told to stay away from the coastline and be on alert for occasional gales. Bus, ferry and rail services were suspended and almost 900 flights were canceled at the city's airport, one of the world's busiest. The South China Morning Post said Hong Kong's hospitals had to use backup power due to outages caused by the storm.\n\nMangkhut earlier lashed the Philippines, sparking landslides and building collapses that killed at least 65 people, with another 43 missing. Authorities reported four deaths from falling trees and building materials in Guangdong, China's manufacturing hub.\n\nAs of Monday morning Mangkhut was on track to pass over the Guangxi regional capital of Nanning and move toward the border with tourism powerhouse Yunnan province.\n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory reported Mangkhut was the most powerful cyclone to hit the city since 1979, packing maximum sustained gusts of 195 kilometers per hour.\n\nTyphoon Mangkhut barreled into southern China after lashing the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain that caused landslides feared to have buried dozens.\n\nMore than 2.4 million people had been evacuated in southern China's Guangdong province by Sunday evening to flee the typhoon, state media said. \"Prepare for the worst,\" Hong Kong Security Minister John Lee Ka-chiu urged residents.\n\nThat warning followed Mangkhut's devastating march through the northern Philippines on Saturday with sustained winds of 205 kph. Landslides caused by the pounding storm hit two villages in Itogon town in the mountain province of Benguet.\n\nItogon Mayor Victorio Palangdan told The Associated Press by phone that at the height of the typhoon's onslaught Saturday afternoon, dozens of people, mostly miners and their families, rushed into an old three-story building in the village of Ucab.\n\nThe building--a former mining bunkhouse that had been transformed into a chapel--was obliterated when part of a mountain slope collapsed. Three villagers who managed to escape told authorities what happened.\n\n\"They thought they were really safe there,\" the mayor said Sunday. He expressed sadness that the villagers, many of them poor, had few options to survive in a region where big corporations have profited immensely from gold mines.\n\nThe rescue work halted for the night before resuming Monday morning. Men used pikes and shovels to dig into the mud since the soaked ground was unstable and limited the use of heavy equipment on site.\n\nThe typhoon was occurring as tropical weather also was devastating the southern United States. Florence has dumped historical levels of rain on North Carolina.\n\nMangkhut made landfall in the Guangdong city of Taishan at 5 p.m. Sunday, packing wind speeds of 162 kph. State television broadcaster CGTN reported that surging waves flooded a seaside hotel in the city of Shenzhen.\n\nThe storm shattered glass windows on commercial skyscrapers in Hong Kong, sending sheets of paper pouring out of the buildings, fluttering and spiraling as they headed for the debris-strewn ground, according to videos on social media.\n\nMangkhut also felled trees, tore scaffolding off buildings under construction and flooded some areas of Hong Kong with waist-high waters, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nCasinos on Macau were ordered closed for the first time due to the typhoon."}]}, {"actual_city": "Raoul Island, New Zealand", "occurence_timestamp": 1552672414015, "occurence_date": "15 Mar 2019", "magnitude": 5.6, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.4 earthquake on Fri, 15 Mar 17:53:35 UTC / Kermadec Islands Region (New Zealand) -", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2257193/M5-Fri-15-Mar-Kermadec-Islands-Region-New-Zealand.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

For decades, Christchurch has also been the center of the country\u2019s small, but persistent white supremacist movement.\n\nAn expert on such fringe groups says it\u2019s probably more than a coincidence that the accused mosque shooter, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, settled in the region, known for a whiter demographic than the country\u2019s north, after frequently traveling abroad in 2016-2018 in what appears to have been an extreme-right pilgrimage.\n\nHe went mostly to areas of Europe with a long history of sectarian dispute, including clashes between Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman Empire and the breakup of Yugoslavia following its ethnic and religious conflicts.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nThe attack has upended New Zealand\u2019s image as one of the world\u2019s safest and most tolerant countries. It has also highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years.\n\nTarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims, according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre. He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months, he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealand\u2019s prime minister minutes before driving to his first target, the golden-domed Al Noor mosque.\n\nPolice say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility. He had five guns, two of which were converted into semi-automatic weapons. It\u2019s likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store.\n\nPossible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealand\u2019s south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl.\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook on Saturday, he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer \u2014 a local police officer who monitors people\u2019s gun licenses \u2014 about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined.\n\nIn the video and comments posted online, Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags, wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia, vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies. He claimed to have met Tarrant, calling him \u201cnot right.\u201d Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahl\u2019s claims further.\n\nAcademic Paul Spoonley, who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand, said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the city\u2019s demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been quieter recently but they haven\u2019t gone away. They are still here,\u201d he said, citing a 2016 incident in which pigs\u2019 heads were left at the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died in Friday\u2019s massacre.\n\nA business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his company\u2019s vans were emblazoned with neo-Nazi references including the \u201cblack sun\u201d symbol that Tarrant\u2019s guns were covered with. The same images, which are used as the company\u2019s branding, appear on its website.\n\nWhen AP visited the registered business address, located in one of Christchurch\u2019s poorer neighborhoods, three of its vans were parked opposite, their \u201cblack sun\u201d imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them. A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans, who did not appear to be the business owner, did not want to answer questions.\n\nPolice on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44-year-old man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he was to appear in court on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Spoonley, the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists, but it\u2019s \u201calways a challenge to get people to accept that they exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by right-wing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups,\u201d he said.\n\nNeighboring Australia\u2019s white supremacist scene is more virulent, in part reflecting the history of its \u201cWhite Australia\u201d immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973. In modern times, the rise of a succession of prominent right-wing politicians \u2014 starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid-1990s \u2014 also legitimized such views.\n\nSpoonley estimates there are 200-250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300-400 people on the fringes.\n\n\u201cI would be very surprised if Tarrant didn\u2019t make some sort of contact,\u201d he said.\n\nThe groups, which emerged in the late 1960s, have evolved over time, coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots, anti-Semitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants, and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.\n\nSpoonley, who researched extreme-right groups in the U.K. in the 1970s, said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations.\n\nBut he quickly found more than 70 extreme-right groups, many of them in Christchurch. He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists, including two that were ideologically motivated \u2014 a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999.\n\nAs Tarrant plotted more recently, Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored.\n\n\u201cThere has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years, including police,\u201d said Anwar Ghani, a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations. \u201cIt was treated not so seriously.\u201d\n\nVerbal abuse, hate emails, hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation, or a combination of the two, are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand, he said.\n\nThe country does not have an official hate crimes database, making it difficult to measure the trend, but some incidents have been widely reported, causing outrage but sparking no real official measures.\n\nGhani said there are dotted lines between last Friday\u2019s massacre, hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme right-wing movements.\n\n\u201cIf the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are getting bolder and bolder.\u201d\n\nPaul Buchanan, a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for US government security agencies, said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand.\n\n\u201cMy interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 9/11 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey decided to go whole hog, 80-85 percent of resources into detecting jihadists,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest was devoted to Marxists, environmentalists, animal rights activists.

About 115 people died. Hundreds of buildings collapsed.\n\nSome 230 school buildings alone around Southern California were destroyed, heavily damaged or judged unsafe to occupy.\n\nIn a March 20, 2008, Los Angeles Times article, Molly Hennessy-Fiske reported:\n\n...The great quake of 1933 helped define the region's reputation as \"earthquake country.\" It was the first destructive quake to occur in the region after a period of rapid growth in the early 20th century. The violent shaking traumatized newcomers \u2014 many of them transplants from the less seismically active Midwest \u2014 and caught government unaware. In the end, the 1933 quake changed the landscape, leading to improved school construction standards and a heightened awareness of earthquake risks.\n\n\"It was a very big political event and a very big event in terms of the development of California seismology,\" said Lucy Jones, a seismologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena.\n\nThe 1933 quake, which occurred on the 46-mile-long Newport-Inglewood fault, was estimated at magnitude 6.3, far weaker than the estimated 8.3-magnitude earthquake that devastated San Francisco in 1906. \u2026\n\nHad the earthquake struck earlier in the day, the death toll would have been much higher: Among the scores of buildings destroyed were 70 schools. \u2026\n\nCalifornia legislators ... reacted swiftly. Within a month of the earthquake, they passed the Field Act, legislation that would become the earthquake's major legacy.\n\nThe Field Act required tougher building standards for new schools, from elementary schools through community colleges, and retrofitting for older schools.\n\nAs a result, subsequent earthquakes have caused fewer deaths, even compared with other countries with stringent building standards such as Japan, said Richard Little, director of the Keston Institute for Public Finance and Infrastructure Policy at USC. \u2026\n\nMarch 10, 1933: Workers going through the rubble of a ruined building after the Long Beach earthquake.

(Asahi Shimbun file photo)\n\nEight years have passed since the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a disaster at the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant on March 11, 2011.\n\nA shadow continues to be cast on the sentiment of the residents of Fukushima Prefecture by a negative public image due to radiation fears and fading public interest in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nWith few inhabitants returning, communities surrounding the crippled nuclear plant are facing tough challenges. In many other areas, radiation readings have dropped to normal levels, and measures to ensure food safety with respect to radiation have been working effectively.\n\nHowever, misunderstandings and overall anxiety linger, mostly outside Fukushima Prefecture, about contamination by radioactive fallout and its negative impact on health.\n\nPeople do not know enough about the current state of the northeastern prefecture. On the contrary, they have less and less opportunities for learning about it.\n\nNEGATIVE IMAGE, FADING INTEREST\n\nDistress and discord persist in Fukushima Prefecture.\n\nThere is, for example, the question of what to do with the ever-growing volume of low-level radioactive water accumulating on the grounds of the stricken nuclear plant. Another issue concerns how to scale down the ongoing blanket testing of all bags of rice produced in Fukushima Prefecture.\n\nRegarding the contaminated water, the government supports a plan to purify and pour it into the ocean. But fishermen\u2019s groups and residents who are concerned about possible negative publicity effects remain strongly opposed, and no clue is in sight to a solution.\n\nNegative publicity is, in fact, hindering rebuilding efforts. The output value of farm products from the prefecture is only 90 percent of its pre-disaster levels. The tourism industry is also still recovering.\n\nFarm crops and fish from Fukushima Prefecture are allowed to circulate only after their safety has been confirmed through rigorous checks. No rice produced in 2015 or later has been found to contain radioactive substances in excess of safety standards.\n\nBut all that has yet to end consumer pullback.\n\nIn a survey taken last month by the Consumer Affairs Agency, some 13 percent of respondents said they hesitate to buy products of Fukushima Prefecture because of possible radioactive content. About 45 percent said they did not know that food products are being screened for radiation.\n\nAt the root of the problem is the fact that knowledge of, interest in and the sense of assurance about matters of radiation differ greatly from person to person.\n\n\u201cAs public interest in Fukushima Prefecture has faded with time, there is probably a considerable broad base of people who have a vaguely negative image getting fixed in their minds,\u201d said Yasumasa Igarashi, an associate professor of sociology with the University of Tsukuba, who is well-versed in the issue of radiation and food.\n\nOVERCOMING DIFFICULTIES\n\nThere are many hurdles to clear before overcoming the negative publicity.\n\nOfficials of public administrative bodies and relevant industries continue to send out messages about scientific knowledge of radiation, and safety measures being taken against it.\n\nTrying to spread facts is certainly an important approach, but there is a limit to what can be done with that alone.\n\nFukushima Prefecture products should first be put at store fronts before they are actually bought by a majority of consumers who are not particularly anxious about radiation. Distributors should be positive about setting due value on the products they handle.\n\nIt is also essential for suppliers to improve on the taste and other positive qualities of their products to enhance their images.\n\nThat said, some are still feeling vaguely anxious, while others are so sensitive to radiation risks that they are consciously shunning products from Fukushima Prefecture. There is a rift and friction between those consumers and the producers in the northeastern prefecture.\n\nDistrust of public administration officials and experts who are handling nuclear power and radiation countermeasures spread across our society following the nuclear disaster. Eight years on, no stage has yet been set for making cool-headed discussions on issues concerning radiation and negative publicity and for seeking solutions that would be acceptable to a broad audience.\n\nBut a clue is seen in Fukushima Prefecture to how that deadlock could be overcome.\n\nSURMOUNTING \u2018DIVIDES\u2019\n\nRiken Komatsu, a 39-year-old community activist based in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, has been working on a program for five years now.\n\nThe participants take a boat and go fishing in the waters off the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. Their catch is tested for radioactive concentration, and the figures are released to the public.\n\nAbout 30 similar measurement sessions have so far taken place. Literally \u201cin the same boat\u201d have been several hundred individuals of differing beliefs and backgrounds, including citizens concerned about radiation, public administration officials, experts, campaigners against nuclear power and those supporting rebuilding efforts.\n\nKomatsu said he realized, through his activity, that people can be moved at heart.\n\nIn those who are feeling \u201cvaguely anxious\u201d about radiation, the combination of hands-on experience and data has generated a sense of heartfelt understanding, and they have switched to being \u201cvaguely assured.\u201d While fishing together, everybody laughs a lot, whatever their stances.\n\nKomatsu said he is trying to ensure that he is bringing fun to the fore to draw people\u2019s interest.\n\n\u201cGetting more people involved in the Fukushima issue without limiting the scope of the audience generates power for fighting the negative public image and the fading public interest,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that having a common experience could offer a clue to surmounting \u2018divides.\u2019\u201d\n\nRegarding the consequences of the nuclear disaster, there are many intersecting axes of divides: one separating those who are concerned and not concerned about radiation; another separating evacuees who return and do not return to their home communities; and yet another separating those who believe and do not believe there should be nuclear power generation.\n\nViolent invectives are being exchanged online. Many have come to see the issue as \u201ctouchy.\u201d Even in Fukushima Prefecture, it is perceived as embarrassing to raise the subject in daily life.\n\nSuch a situation is making it even more difficult to clean up after the disaster, including in the decades-long process of reactor decommissioning, and to rehabilitate regional communities of residents who have gone asunder.\n\nIt is, however, a vital responsibility imposed on our entire society to eliminate the pain brought about as a result of a national policy of promoting the use of atomic energy. It will remain a key question for us on how we will face up to the Fukushima issue.\n\nWe should first learn about the affected communities as they are now and update any information and images we have of them. We could then reinstate an environment where things that have gone awry are disentangled one by one so that people can make constructive discussions while respecting the ideas of others.\n\nWe hope to see society press a restart button so Fukushima Prefecture can tread on a clear path of rebuilding.\n\n--The Asahi Shimbun, March 10"}, {"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Sun, 17 Mar 14:27:20 UTC / Off East Coast Of Honshu, Japan - 1 experience report", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2258492/M4-Sun-17-Mar-Off-East-Coast-Of-Honshu-Japan.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

One clue, however, was a forest of dead trees standing along the Copalis River in Washington.\n\nIn the massive flood, the land on which the trees were standing dropped over six feet and was completely inundated with salt water, turning the dense forest into a marsh. The now dead trees have remained standing ever since, ghostly grey poles dotting the landscape.\n\nAlthough an enormous tsunami had been recorded in Edo-period Japan around 1700, and Native American and First Nations peoples had passed down stories of this devastating earthquake that could be dated to approximately the same time, scientific investigation of the ghost forest at Copalis provided detailed evidence of this seismic event.\n\nThe enormous grove of ghostly red cedars, geologists Brian Atwater and David Yamaguchi discovered, was killed by an inundation of salt water. The 1700 Cascadia Earthquake, whose date was confirmed by reports from the Kwakwaka\u2019wakw indigenous group of British Columbia to records kept from 18th century Japan, had caused the trees to die all at once, rather than over time as had been previously supposed. For more information on the research Atwater and Yamaguchi conducted at Copalis, see this USGS report."}, {"title": "Indonesia quake update: 6.3-strong aftershock felt; tsunami warning likely", "url": "https://www.iloveqatar.net/news/general/indonesia-quake-update-6-3-strong-aftershock-felt-tsunami-warning-likely", "content": "The US Geological Survey (USGS) announced that the holiday island of Lombok, located in the biggest Muslim country in the world, has been shaken by another strong earthquake today (August 18), after weeks of tremors that have killed more than 460 people.\n\n\"Sunday's quake measured a 6.3-magnitude and was at a depth of 7.9km (4.9 miles).

It leveled homes, mosques and businesses, displaced hundreds of thousands of people, including many tourists.\n\n\n\nA disaster mitigation agency spokesman said that activity on the island was normal and Mount Rinjani, where hundreds of trekkers were stranded after the July 29 quake, was closed and there are no tourists there at the moment.\n\nLombok suffered damage running to more than 5 trillion rupiah ($342 million) from the Aug. 5 earthquake, authorities said last week.\n\nMore than 350,000 people fled their homes after that quake to shelter in government-provided tents or makeshift structures in open fields. Authorities said aid was slow getting to some of the hardest-hit areas as they are remote.\n\nLombok, which lies just east of Bali, is Indonesia's most famous tourist destination.\n\nSame with Lombok, another part of the globe is experiencing such natural disasters.

Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally. Methods The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950. Findings Globally, 18\u00b77% (95% uncertainty interval 18\u00b74\u201319\u00b70) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58\u00b78% (58\u00b72\u201359\u00b73) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48\u00b71 years (46\u00b75\u201349\u00b76) to 70\u00b75 years (70\u00b71\u201370\u00b78) for men and from 52\u00b79 years (51\u00b77\u201354\u00b70) to 75\u00b76 years (75\u00b73\u201375\u00b79) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49\u00b71 years (46\u00b75\u201351\u00b77) for men in the Central African Republic to 87\u00b76 years (86\u00b79\u201388\u00b71) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216\u00b70 deaths (196\u00b73\u2013238\u00b71) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38\u00b79 deaths (35\u00b76\u201342\u00b783) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5\u00b74 million (5\u00b72\u20135\u00b76) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development. Interpretation This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

Additionally, previous iterations of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) have produced these estimates on an annual basis. UNPOP reports age-specific mortality by 5-year age groups for 162 countries and for time periods that cover 5 calendar years; these estimates are updated every 2 years (most recently in June, 2017). The United States Census Bureau produces mortality assessments for 15\u201325 countries per year, and WHO reports periodically on life expectancy and sometimes on other measures of mortality and bases its estimates on results from the UNPOP. The most recent release of estimates by WHO was in January, 2017, based on UNPOP estimates from 2015. GBD 2016 provided comprehensive assessment of age-sex-specific mortality for 195 countries and territories from 1970 to 2016 that were compliant with the Guidelines on Accurate and Transparent Reporting of Health Estimates.

The most important changes in GBD 2017 are the independent estimation of population and a comprehensive update on fertility, which are described in a separate paper. There are several countries with significant differences in population size between the UNPOP estimates and the new GBD estimates. Since population is the denominator for mortality calculations, this leads to substantial changes in life expectancy and age-specific mortality rates in several countries. There were four major data additions and improvements that related to the estimation of mortality. First, for the estimation of population size, we systematically searched for census data and found data from 1257 censuses, which are now used in the analysis and which enabled an extended analysis of completeness using death distribution methods in more locations than previous iterations. Second, in the estimation of adult mortality, we included data from 31 Demographic Surveillance Sites (DSS) which were adjusted based on the relationship between DSS under-5 death rates and national under-5 death rates. Third, we used published sources to create a database of fatal discontinuities from conflicts and natural disasters that extends back to 1950; each fatal discontinuity has been given a unique ID that tags the reported deaths to a location, date, and type of discontinuity. Fourth, GBD 2017 included an additional 622 data sources that were not available for GBD 2016 and which do not fall into the three categories already described. The main methodological improvements fall into two categories: the first category is enhancements to the modelling framework, which improved the estimation of both child mortality, defined as the probability of death below the age of 5 years, and adult mortality, a term we use to refer to the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years. For child mortality, we standardised hyperparameter selection for the spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models, which enhances the comparability of results between locations and across time. For adult mortality, we also standardised hyperparameter selection and added child mortality as a covariate to the model. These changes had minimal effect on the mean estimate but changed the width of the uncertainty intervals in small populations and locations with sparse data. The second category encompasses three substantial improvements to the GBD model life table system: first, we revised the entire database to reflect the change in population counts. Second, each life table in the database was assigned a quality score using explicit criteria related to the variance in the slope of the death rate with respect to age, reductions in mortality at older ages compared with younger ages (age >60 years), and other unexpected crossovers. On the basis of these quality scores, life tables have been assigned to three categories: high quality for universal use, acceptable quality for use in the creation of location-specific standards, and unacceptable quality. Third, we estimated complete single-year life tables for each sex, location, and year instead of abridged life tables as in previous iterations of the GBD. In GBD 2017, for the first time, we are reporting a complete time series of trends in age-specific mortality and life expectancy since 1950. The extension of the analysis back in time provides the opportunity to analyse and report on longer-term trends in age-specific mortality. Implications of all the available evidence By using internally consistent estimates of deaths, births, and population over time, this analysis of trends in age-sex-specific death rates and summary measures such as life expectancy provides important perspectives on how mortality has been evolving since 1950. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the remarkable decline in under-5 mortality. This great success story reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades, a commitment that has intensified since the turn of the century. At the same time, our findings also bring attention to mortality patterns that are cause for concern, particularly among men aged 20\u201345 years and, to a lesser extent, women aged 20\u201345 years. In these groups, our findings show mortality rates that have stagnated over the time period covered by this study, and in some cases, are increasing. Comparing levels of mortality to those expected on the basis of development status, as measured with the Socio-demographic Index, provides insights into which countries have achieved lower and which countries are experiencing higher mortality rates than would be expected based on their level of development. Our findings show enormous variation in progress achieved across locations and ages, with countries that are performing better than expected in all regions of the world. Our results also highlight that greater emphasis needs to be placed on understanding the drivers of success for countries that have performed better than expected and that urgent attention needs to be brought to those countries that are lagging behind.\n\nIntroduction 1 Harkness AG Age at marriage and at death in the Roman Empire. , 2 Scheidel W Disease and death in the ancient city of Rome. 3 UN Sustainable development knowledge platform. Measurement of mortality has always been crucial for populations, and mortality is a quantity that societies have attempted to track since ancient times.More recently, its relevance and importance have been highlighted in the global agenda in the form of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which not only include two indicators expressly focused on all-cause mortality (SDG indicators 3.2.1, under-5 mortality, and 3.2.2, neonatal mortality), but also death registration (SDG indicator 17.19.2c) and ten indicators of cause-specific or risk-attributable mortality.The prominence of mortality among the health-related SDGs intensifies the need for comparable, robust measurements of mortality that can be used for monitoring progress on mortality levels and trends across countries. National governments and international agencies alike need reliable evidence to identify and then prioritise addressing the largest challenges in improving survival, particularly during the SDG era. 4 GBD 2016 Mortality Collaborators Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970\u20132016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. , 5 Ahmad OB\n\nLopez AD\n\nInoue M The decline in child mortality: a reappraisal. , 6 You D\n\nJin NR\n\nWardlaw T Levels & trends in child mortality. , 7 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Trends in aging\u2014United States and worldwide. , 8 Roser M Life expectancy.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) provides the only source of annually updated age-sex-specific mortality for countries across the world. Three other analytical efforts exist that provide estimates of age-specific mortality for a broad set of countries; however, we believe that these are not as comprehensive or timely as the GBD. The United Nations Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP) has reported on life expectancy and age-specific mortality for 5-year calendar intervals by age, sex, and country since 2005 and for 201 countries. Their estimates are updated biannually; however, the estimates are not reported with uncertainty intervals (UIs).The US Census Bureau analyses only 15\u201325 countries per year and updates demographic estimates for them.WHO estimates of mortality are largely based on UNPOP estimates that have been interpolated to single years with some modifications for countries with complete vital registration (VR).In addition to these cross-national efforts, many countries produce their own estimates of age-specific mortality, which often differ from the international assessments. 14 Wang H\n\nAbajobir AA\n\nAbate KH\n\net al.

GBD 2017 represents the third iteration of the annual updates of the GBD.This version of the GBD reports on trends in age-specific mortality and summary measures of mortality, such as life expectancy, with four main improvements. First, new data sources that have been released or reported since GBD 2016 have been incorporated. Second, for the first time, estimates of age-sex-specific population generated in the GBD are used in the estimation of all-cause mortality, whereas previous efforts by the GBD used the UN Population Division estimates of population by age and sex.Third, statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved. Lastly, we have extended the analysis and reporting of age-specific mortality back to 1950 to further contribute to research and analyses of long-term trends in mortality and life expectancy.\n\nMethods Overview 32 Stevens GA\n\nAlkema L\n\nBlack RE\n\net al. Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting: the GATHER statement. As with GBD 2016, this analysis adheres to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) standards developed by WHO and others. table detailing our adherence to GATHER is included in appendix 1 ; statistical code used in the entire process is publicly available online . Analyses were done with Python versions 2.5.4 and 2.7.3, Stata version 13.1, and R version 3.1.2. The methods used to produce estimates of age-specific mortality remain similar to those used in GBD 2016. Here we provide a broad overview and highlight the major changes since GBD 2016. All other details are included in appendix 1 Geographical units and time periods The GBD is hierarchically organised by geographic units or locations, with seven super-regions, 21 regions nested within those super-regions, and 195 countries or territories within the 21 regions. Each year, GBD includes subnational analyses for a few new countries and continues to provide subnational estimates for countries that were added in previous cycles. Subnational estimation in GBD 2017 includes five new countries (Ethiopia, Iran, New Zealand, Norway, Russia) and countries previously estimated at subnational levels (GBD 2013: China, Mexico, and the UK [regional level]; GBD 2015: Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, South Africa, Sweden, and the USA; GBD 2016: Indonesia and the UK [local government authority level]). All analyses are at the first level of administrative organisation within each country except for New Zealand (by M\u0101ori ethnicity), Sweden (by Stockholm and non-Stockholm), and the UK (by local government authorities). All subnational estimates for these countries were incorporated into model development and evaluation as part of GBD 2017. To meet data use requirements, in this publication we present all subnational estimates excluding those pending publication (Brazil, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Sweden, the UK, and the USA); these results are presented in appendix tables and figures appendix 2 ). Subnational estimates for countries with populations larger than 200 million (as measured with our most recent year of published estimates) that have not yet been published elsewhere are presented wherever estimates are illustrated with maps, but are not included in data tables. Data and data processing In the estimation of age-specific mortality for GBD 2017, we used five types of data. These were data from VR systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites (DSS). 33 Murray CJ\n\nRajaratnam JK\n\nMarcus J\n\nLaakso T\n\nLopez AD What can we conclude from death registration?

The most robust source for estimating age-specific mortality is a VR system that records all deaths by age, sex, and location. Our analysis of mortality starts with collating all publicly available VR data plus data shared directly by governments or GBD collaborators from VR systems. We evaluate the completeness of VR data separately for deaths under the age of 5 years and deaths over the age of 15 years. For under-5 deaths, we statistically compare VR-based death rates with those recorded in censuses or surveys. For deaths over the age of 15 years, we apply three methods for detecting under-registration: generalised growth balance, synthetic extinct generations, and a hybrid method that uses both methods.These methods are collectively described as death distribution methods because they use the demographic balance equation to infer completeness of registration. Age misreporting and migration affect these methods.We used the spatiotemporal regression framework with the results of these methods for all intercensal intervals to produce a coherent time series of completeness for each location. For this step, the first stage of the model uses completeness of child death registration as a covariate and then applies time and space weights on the residuals to produce a smoothed result. In some countries, sample registration systems are operated wherein events are recorded in detail for a representative sample of communities within those countries. We used the same death distribution methods to evaluate the completeness of these sources as for VR; sample registration death counts were scaled in the death distribution methods analysis to the national level. This study considers a country to have complete VR when it used a civil registration system, vital statistics, or sample registration system that captures at least 95% of all deaths within the country. When calculating death rates for under-5 mortality, adult mortality, or empirical life tables, we used the GBD population estimates by age, sex, location, and year as the denominator. 39 Rajaratnam JK\n\nTran LN\n\nLopez AD\n\nMurray CJL Measuring under-five mortality: validation of new low-cost methods. In addition to VR data, for the estimation of under-5 death rates, we use data from complete birth histories collected through household survey programmes, including the World Fertility Survey, Demographic and Health Surveys, some Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and various other national surveys. A wider set of surveys and many censuses also collect data on the number of livebirths for a woman and the number of these children who are still surviving. This information is called a summary birth history and can yield an unbiased assessment of the trend in the under-5 death rate. 40 Obermeyer Z\n\nRajaratnam JK\n\nPark CH\n\net al. Measuring adult mortality using sibling survival: a new analytical method and new results for 44 countries, 1974\u20132006. 41 Department of International Economic and Social Affairs Manual X. Indirect techniques for demographic estimation: a collaboration of the Population Division of the Department of International Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat with the Committee on Population and Demography of the National Research Council, United States National Academy of Sciences. Assessments of adult mortality, in addition to VR and sample registration data, use survey data collected on sibling histories. A sibling history means that a respondent is asked to report on the survival or death of each of their siblings; in other words, the respondent provides a complete birth history for their mother. Sibling histories are subject to survivor bias and recall bias. Sibling history data are processed for GBD using methods that address these limitations.Some surveys and some censuses also use information on deaths in a household over some recent time interval\u2014for example, the past 12 months. Studies suggest that respondents can over-report or under-report deaths of household members.We apply death distribution methods to assess completeness, which can be greater than 100% due to telescoping of event reporting, which happens when a respondent reports an event that happened before the recall period as if it happened during the recall period. For GBD 2017, we also included DSS data on adult mortality for the first time, specifically on the probability of death between the ages of 15 and 60 years (45q15), from local communities that are under direct surveillance. Because these DSS communities are not nationally representative, we adjusted the level of 45q15 based on the ratio of the probability of death from birth to age 5 years (5q0) from the DSS to the national 5q0, taking into account that the relationship between 5q0 and 45q15 changes as the level of 5q0 declines because, on average, there are larger declines in 5q0 than in 45q15 over time. New data for GBD 2017 compared to GBD 2016 In GBD 2017, we have added 458 location-years of VR data at the national level and 9 location-years of VR data at the subnational level compared with GBD 2016. We also included an additional 62 complete birth history sources at the national level, 12 complete birth history sources at the subnational level, 72 national summary birth history sources, and 16 subnational summary birth history data sources. 11 national and seven subnational sibling history surveys were also added. We included 1529 datapoints from DSSs in 15 countries. The total numbers of datapoints used were 181 625 for under-5 mortality estimation and 63 234 for adult mortality estimation. We also used 35 177 empirical life tables in the all-cause mortality database for GBD 2017. Appendix 1 provides complete lists of data availability and data sources by location; these are also available using our online source tool, the Global Health Data Exchange . The addition of these data has provided increasingly accurate mortality metrics in many countries over all years estimated in GBD.

Global, regional, and national incidence and mortality for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria during 1990\u20132013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. Using all the VR, complete birth history, and summary birth history data available for each country, we estimate the time trends from 1950 to 2017 for each location. We use spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression (ST-GPR) to estimate time trends. This model has four components. First, it includes three covariates: lag-distributed income (LDI) per capita, average years of schooling for women aged 15\u201349 years, and the crude rate of death from HIV/AIDS.Second, it includes random effects for each source of data in each country, where a source refers to a particular survey or census. Using the random effects, data are adjusted to the reference source for each country. The reference source is VR in countries with complete VR and complete birth histories in countries without complete VR. In some locations, reference sources are selected on the basis of expert knowledge of a country and its data sources provided by GBD collaborators. The third component of the model borrows strength over space and time by smoothing the residuals; the degree of smoothing is controlled by three hyperparameters. These hyperparameters are a time weight (lambda), a space weight (zeta), and a temporal correlation weight (scale). Additional details on the selection of the hyperparameters are included in appendix 1 section 2.2 . The fourth component of the model uses the output after the first three components have been run as the mean prior in a Gaussian process regression. Gaussian process regression also includes four hyperparameters, lambda, zeta, scale, and an additional hyperparameter, amplitude. Details on these hyperparameters are included in appendix 1 . In GBD 2017, to standardise our analysis further, we have opted to use the same amplitude for all locations. The value for amplitude is based on the analysis of variation over time in countries with complete VR that is not explained by the covariates. We use a multiphase approach to generate age-specific and age-sex-specific under-5 mortality. We first model the ratio of male to female 5q0. Next, we run separate models to estimate the probability of death for each sex and age group, specifically early neonatal (0\u20136 days), late neonatal (7\u201327 days), postneonatal (28\u2013364 days), infant mortality (<1 year), and childhood mortality (between 1 and 5 years). These are run to take advantage of greater data density for both the ratio of male to female mortality and the split between infant mortality and childhood mortality as compared with the split of infant mortality into the components of early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal. Each is modelled using ST-GPR. Results of the sex-ratio model are first applied to derive sex-specific under-5 death rates (U5MR). Next, the probability of death from birth to the exact age of 1 year and from age 1 year to the exact age of 5 years are transformed to conditional probabilities and scaled to the sex-specific U5MR estimates. This is done to ensure that the value of 1 minus the probabilities from birth to the exact age of 1 year and from age 1 year to the exact age of 5 years equals the probability of death between birth and the exact age of 5 years. Lastly, early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal model results are transformed to conditional probabilities and scaled in the same manner to equal the sex-specific probability of death from birth to the exact age of 1 year. More information on the models, model hyperparameters, and scaling can be found in appendix 1 section 2.2 Estimating the probability of death between ages 15 and 60 years 42 Global Burden of Disease Health Financing Collaborator Network Trends in future health financing and coverage: future health spending and universal health coverage in 188 countries, 2016\u201340. , 43 Gakidou E\n\nCowling K\n\nLozano R\n\nMurray CJ Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis. , 44 Murray CJL\n\nOrtblad KF\n\nGuinovart C\n\net al.

In the first stage model, we use LDI per capita, average years of schooling for the population aged 15\u201359 years, the crude rate of death from HIV/AIDS, and the under-5 mortality rate as covariates.Under-5 mortality rate was not used as a covariate in GBD 2016, but we found that the model, which is now estimating for a longer time period going back to 1950, performs better when this covariate is included. We model the data for males and females together and include a dummy variable for sex in the model. In GBD 2016, we had run separate models for males and females, but this had yielded implausible sex ratios of adult mortality rates in specific location-years. More details, including hyperparameters for the ST-GPR model, are described in appendix 1 section 2.3 GBD model life table system and the database of empirical life tables 14 Wang H\n\nAbajobir AA\n\nAbate KH\n\net al. Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970\u20132016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016. To produce a complete set of age-specific mortality rates (an abridged life table ) for each location, we used the GBD model life table system, which identifies a reference life table for each location, year, and sex, on the basis of the nearest matches found in our empirical life table database.As we have revised the population denominators used to create the empirical life tables in GBD 2017, we have substantially updated and revised the database of empirical life tables as well. In previous GBD iterations, we excluded life tables based on implausible patterns of variation in death rates in the age groups older than 40 years. As with previous GBD cycles, we have two sets of life tables that meet inclusion criteria: a universal set that is used for all locations to identify matches and a location-specific set that is used for each location along with the universal set. We have formalised the inclusion criteria for life tables for both the location-specific and the universal set, and those are listed in section 2.4 of appendix 1 . Life tables that meet all of the general inclusion criteria but not all of the universal life table inclusion criteria are categorised as location-specific life tables. For each life table, within each location, we sort life tables by year and generate smoothed life tables using moving averages of widths 3, 5, and 7 adjacent years within each location. This smoothing helps to address jumps or drops in age-specific mortality in locations where small numbers of deaths resulted in high variability of mortality patterns across age. After separately categorising each life table, we keep the least-smoothed of the candidate life tables within each life table set. The smoothing process and inclusion criteria help to address implausible age patterns from countries with small populations, unstable death rates, or poor data quality. We have also set the number of matches searched for in the databases to be 100 for all locations; to ensure that locations with high-quality data primarily rely on their own age patterns of mortality, we have modified the space-time weighting scheme through a 25-fold increase in the country-specific weights compared with GBD 2016, with an additional 15-fold increase in 0-year and 1-year lag country-specific weights and a three-fold increase in the 2-year, 3-year, and 4-year lag country-specific weights. We also generated a new geographical strata of life table weights for subnational locations that are within the same country, which were assigned the same value as the original GBD 2016 country-specific weights. For both all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses in GBD, we amassed a comprehensive database on human mortality from full VR systems and sample VR systems such as the Sample Registration System (SRS) from India and the Disease Surveillance Point system from China. These data sources provided a total of 42 138 empirical life tables, which also include subnational locations. After applying inclusion criteria, we use 35 177 life tables, of which 10 885 are universal and 24 292 location-specific. The GBD model life tables varied in quality in accordance with the coverage of a location's VR: for locations where VR coverage was high, the standard was overwhelmingly derived from observed mortality patterns, whereas in locations where VR coverage was low, the standard was based on locations with similar under-5 and adult mortality rates, with more weight given to life tables that were closer geographically and temporally. The selection of geographically and temporally similar locations helped to capture differences in mortality patterns by age due to specific causes of death. Single-year life tables 31 GBD 2017 Population and Fertility collaborators Population and fertility by age and sex for 195 countries and territories 1950\u20132017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 2017. To support the estimation of single-year population for each location-age-sex-year, we have also generated single-year life tables for all locations from the abridged life tables after the HIV/AIDS mortality reconcilliation process and the addition of fatal discontinuities. Our method for generating single-year probabilities of death that are consistent with the abridged life table probabilities of death and known data on single-year patterns is described in the GBD 2017 population and fertility publication. Fatal discontinuities Fatal discontinuities are idiosyncratic increases in mortality that would affect long-term mortality trends if modelled using the all-cause mortality estimation process, and as a result, are estimated separately. Events categorised as fatal discontinuities are epidemics (such as Ebola virus disease or cholera); natural disasters, major technological or transport accidents, and war and terrorism. The specific data sources used to compile fatal discontinuities can be explored using the online source tool, the Global Health Data Exchange, and are described in detail in appendix 1 section 4 . Estimates from high-quality VR systems were included instead of estimates from other sources in the event that conflicting sources were identified for a fatal discontinuity, with few exceptions when there was evidence to suggest that the VR system was compromised by the event. Regional, cause-specific UIs were used to estimate uncertainty for events where only point-estimate mortality data were available. For GBD 2017, we have recoded the locations of all events using a new suite of software developed in-house to match differently coded locations in the fatal discontinuities database to GBD locations, taking advantage of detailed location information that was presented in non-standardised ways\u2014eg, sources that included the name of a city or village instead of latitude and longitude. We first overlaid the portions of the database with latitude-longitude coordinates to the most detailed GBD location. When coordinates were not available, we used three web-based geocoding services\u2014the Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Geonames geocoding application programming interfaces\u2014to get a set of possible latitude and longitude coordinates from the location, overlaid those coordinates on to GBD locations, and then used the most common result from the three services to assign a GBD location. Since discontinuities for recent years are not well tracked in the available databases, we have supplemented these databases with online searches. For GBD 2017, we systematised the identification of events missing from our database by mining Twitter accounts of major news providers for common terms associated with such events, like \u201cearthquake\u201d and \u201ccasualties.\u201d This provided 62 events. Once events were identified, news reports of death totals, location, and date were used. The age pattern of deaths is rarely identified in databases of fatal discontinuities. In order to estimate an age and sex distribution, events were first assigned to a GBD cause. Events were then split based on both the global age and sex distribution of that cause of death and the age and sex distribution of the population in the GBD location of the event, following the GBD causes of death age-sex-splitting algorithm. The main effect of this effort is that we are much less likely to miss shocks or allocate them to the wrong subnational location. HIV/AIDS in countries with large epidemics and incomplete VR 45 Ghys PD\n\nBrown T\n\nGrassly NC\n\net al. The UNAIDS Estimation and Projection Package: a software package to estimate and project national HIV epidemics. We produced estimates of adult HIV/AIDS incidence and prevalence using the estimation and projection package (EPP), a Bayesian model developed by UNAIDS.Our implementation of EPP made use of GBD-estimated demographic parameters, mortality rates for people on and off antiretroviral therapy, and CD4 progression rates to fit a model to HIV/AIDS prevalence data from surveillance sites and representative surveys. EPP-generated incidence and prevalence time series were used as inputs into Spectrum, a compartmental HIV/AIDS progression model originally developed by UNAIDS. Spectrum generated a full set of age-sex-specific HIV/AIDS mortality rates using detailed demographic parameters that align with those used for EPP. In countries with VR data, we adjusted age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates to produce mortality estimates that better fit observed deaths. In parallel, the GBD model life table process produced a separate set of HIV/AIDS death estimates, which were reconciled with Spectrum outputs to produce final mortality estimates. For countries with high-quality VR systems, mortality estimates were generated using ST-GPR on VR data. Analysing the relationship between age-specific mortality rates and development status 31 GBD 2017 Population and Fertility collaborators Population and fertility by age and sex for 195 countries and territories 1950\u20132017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease 2017. To characterise development status, we used the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on the total fertility under the age of 25 years (TFU25), average educational attainment in those aged 15 years or older, and LDI. Compared with GBD 2016, the SDI calculation in GBD 2017 has been refined to use TFU25 instead of the total fertility rate because TFU25 does not show a U-shaped pattern with development at higher levels of development status and is a better proxy for the status of women in society.Aggregate SDI groupings were generated by applying quintile cutoffs from the distribution of national-level SDI for countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2017 to estimates of SDI for all GBD locations in 2017. The SDI analysis is described in further detail in appendix 1 (section 3) ; additional detail on correlation for the weighted scores is also provided. To evaluate the average relationship between SDI and all-cause mortality, we fit a generalised additive model with a Loess smoother on SDI by age and sex group using GBD 2017 estimates from 1950 to 2017. The expected value is based solely on SDI status and does not vary over time. Examination of how the ratio of observed death rates to expected death rates changes over time allows us to explore the impact of how the relationships are changing over time. The expected age-sex-specific mortality rates were subsequently used to generate a complete life table expected on the basis of SDI alone. Uncertainty analysis We estimate uncertainty systematically throughout the all-cause mortality estimation process. We generated 1000 draws for each all-cause mortality metric, and 95% UIs are calculated using the 2\u00b75th and 97\u00b75th percentiles of the draw-level values. Analytical steps are connected at the draw level, and the uncertainty of key mortality metrics is propagated throughout the all-cause mortality estimation process. Uncertainty in under-5 mortality and adult mortality rate estimation and completeness synthesis are estimated using non-sampling error and sampling error by data source. For the model life table step and HIV/AIDS-specific mortality calculations, uncertainty was estimated from uncertainty in the life table standard and from the regression parameters and sampling error in the EPP, respectively. Role of the funding source The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors had full access to the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nDiscussion Main findings This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of age-sex-specific death rates for single calendar years and single-year age groups for 195 countries and territories from 1950 to 2017. Our results show the remarkable variation in mortality rates over time and across countries. The decline in death rates has been the greatest in the age groups younger than 5 years, followed by young adults, and has been slower among older adults. Rising death rates have occurred in conflicts, natural disasters, large HIV epidemics, and in several locations such as eastern Europe, some countries in southeast Asia and Latin America, and most recently, in the USA. Increases in adult mortality rates even as child death rates fall are stark reminders that the drivers of adult mortality can be complex. Because of the celebrated progress in many locations, many people have come to expect age-specific death rates to always decline; however, there is nothing inevitable about the trajectory of death rates, particularly in adults.

Dissonant health transition in the states of Mexico, 1990\u20132013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013. A long-running theme in the demographic literature has been the balance between development and technology innovation as determinants of mortality change. Thomas McKeown,examining declines in mortality in the UK in the first half of the 20th century, argued that health technology played little role and mortality decline in that setting was driven by improvements in the standard of living. Samuel Preston,in a series of classic studies, roughly assigned one-third of life expectancy improvement to rising income per capita, one-third to improvements in educational attainment, and one-third to changes correlated with time, which he assigned to technology improvement. Given the wide array of drugs, vaccines, and procedures and understanding of risk factors that have emerged in the past 50 years, often with strong causal evidence such as randomised trials, major temporal shifts unexplained by development should be expected.

Erickson Dela Cruz\n\nMANILA -- One of the very first PETA musicals I had ever seen was Vincent de Jesus's \"Si Juan Tamad, Ang Diyablo at Ang Limang Milyong Boto\" back in February 2010. Nine years later, almost exactly to the day, I was back at the PETA Theater again to watch another play about Philippine politics and elections. This new musical is by J-mee Katanyag and Michelle Ngu, entitled \"Charot!\" with music by Vince Lim.\n\nIt was already Election Day in May 2020. The proposed \"Charter of Togetherness\" endorsed by President Papsy (Jack Yabut) was up for a referendum to determine if the Filipino people will ratify it or not. The word \"Charot\" (gayspeak for \"just kidding\") was being sardonically used as a derogatory nickname for this charter by those against it. The main story of the play follows eight individuals who were on their way to their polling precinct to vote.\n\nThere was a hyper-excited vlogger Millennial Girl (Gardo Vicente) who wanted to document her election devirginization together with and cynical boyfriend Millennial Boy (CJ Navato). There was a pregnant Nanay (Kitsi Pagaspas) whose store's very existence relied on her casting a vote. There was a street vendor (Norbs Portales), a gay ex-OFW carpool driver (Lemuel Silvestre), a SuperMall salesgirl (Rhapsody Li), a very busty nurse Grethel Tuba (Gold Villar-Lim) and a traffic enforcer they called Boss (Jason Barcial).\n\nAct 1 was about their plight while stranded on top of their vehicles in a traffic standstill on a flyover on a very flooded EDSA. This part was largely a descriptive comparison between the behavior of the upper and lower socioeconomic classes when it came to their various reasons for voting, as well as their behavior during a stressful crisis. Stranded with them in this part was Mary Grace (Meann Espinosa), a self-important, self-absorbed rich girl whose peg everyone will recognize.\n\nA scene from PETA's 'Charot!' Erickson Dela Cruz\n\nAct 2 was the real meat of the story, with the original group was divided into two subgroups. Five of them hitched a ride on a helicopter with a pro-charot pilot (Jack Yabut again). Five of them hitched a ride on a speedboat with an anti-charot activist nun Sister Joy (Meann Espinosa again). En route to the polling center, the two groups would learn more vital pros and cons about federalism and the important choice that they were going to make in that referendum. The answer was just a simple 'Yes' or 'No,' but the irreversible result will significantly alter the country's way of life.\n\nI enjoyed the very catchy songs with music written and arranged by Vince Lim with pithy witty lyrics by Michelle Ngu. The script of Katanyag and Ngu stuffed in all sorts of pop culture references, current or past, political or otherwise, from a controversial Presidential kiss to Catriona Gray's lava walk. It was a lot of fun catching all these little details which got squeezed in the mix.\n\nIt was also an interactive show, with the audience encouraged to join in online polls on their gadgets. Conducted in real time, there is free inhouse Wi-fi provided for this purpose.\n\nThe wacky cast went all out with their slapstick comedy, but remained real convincing during their serious moments. Everybody will get his and her own spot number to showcase their inidividual talents.\n\nA scene from PETA's 'Charot!' Erickson Dela Cruz\n\nGardo (yes she's female) Vicente and \"Goin Bulilit\" original CJ Navato played Millenial Girl and Boy whose relationship will also go through the wringer on that fateful day. (Teetin Villanueva and Bene Manaois alternate in these roles.) Kitsi Pagaspas was so delightfully over-the-top as the desperate Nanay. Gold Villar-Lim slayed her big silicone implants and the high notes as Grethel Tuba. (Jimma Mariz alternates as Grethel.)\n\nRhapsody Li was very impressive in her SuperMall Lady rap and dance number. (Icee Po alternates as SuperMall Lady.) Jason Barcial seemed to be channeling Gen. Bato de la Rosa in his performance as Boss. (Roi Calilong alternates as Boss.) Norbs Portales was cheerfully shameless as the \"jologs\" street vendor. Lemuel Silvestre's \"beki\" character was untypically subdued as gay characters in PETA go. (Gio Gahol alternates as Beki.)\n\nAfter an acclaimed restrained performance in \"Manila Notes\" last December, Meann Espinosa showed off her more rambunctious side in her three distinct characters here. In Act 1, her impersonations of Kris Aquino and Karen Davila were especially spot on and hilarious. In Act 2, her Sister Joy was an authoritative and credible subject matter expert, to get the important message of the play through to the audience.\n\nJack Yabut also played three distinct characters. His appearances as President Papsy and a construction worker in Act 1 were short but funny. But in Act 2, as the helicopter pilot, we hear him present all the pro-charter change and pro-federalism arguments. Towards the end of this segment of the show, he revealed a startling detail regarding the federalism agenda I myself was not aware about.\n\nA scene from PETA's 'Charot!' Erickson Dela Cruz\n\nThe comparative discussion about federalism and charter change was eye-opening and sobering. They even distributed FAQ leaflets for the audience to reflect on some more after the show. An open forum was held after the show to allow audiences to vent their sentiments about the show they just watched with the writers and some cast members.\n\nThe writers try to be fair in presenting the pros and cons, although their real stand and sentiments seemed quite apparent. I feel that the people who will be watching this play will probably be those who think like the writers. However, in the true spirit of PETA, this play really needs to go out into the communities and reach the grassroots in order to spread their cautionary message.\n\nThe creative team of \"Charot!\" is led by director Maribel Legarda with her assistant director Ian Segarra, who was also the choreographer. Boni Juan designed the simple yet imaginative sets with the props made of recycled materials. Gio Gahol (costume stylist), Jonjon Villareal (lights designer) and Ellen Ramos (video and animation) were the other talents working behind the scenes.\n\n\"Charot!\" runs at the PETA Phinma Theater until March 17 with 8 p.m. shows on Fridays and Saturdays, and matinees at 3 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nThis review was originally published in the author's blog, \"Fred Said.\""}, {"title": "'But Javi's a guy!'

Experts predict an 8.8 magnitude quake could occur off the island of Hokkaido sometime in the next three decades.\n\nOn December 19th, a government panel released its projections of the probability and scale of quakes that might happen along the Chishima Trench.\n\nMassive earthquakes have struck the area at intervals of about 350 years. The last one was 400 years ago.\n\nThe panel's members say the probability of such a quake in the next 30 years is 7 to 40 percent.\n\nThe head of the panel, University of Tokyo professor Naoshi Hirata, says, \"A quake like the March 2011 temblor off northeastern Japan could happen. We want people to remember that a tsunami occurs when a big quake strikes off the coast.\"\n\nRegional officials are concerned with the projections. Hokkaido prefectural official Hiroki Mori says, \"We take the evaluation very seriously. We always have to be prepared for a possible quake.\"\n\nThe Chishima Trench has been the location of numerous quakes\n\nThere was one off the Nemuro peninsula in 1973. In 2003, a magnitude 8.0 quake struck just off Tokachi, causing a tsunami of four meters hit the town of Erimo.\n\nThe latest analysis by the panel estimates the quake zone to be in areas off Tokachi and Nemuro, and off the islands of Shikotan and Etorofu.\n\nThe report also warns that there is a high chance of an imminent mega-quake that will trigger large tsunamis off eastern Hokkaido.\n\nAkio Nakayama is in charge of crisis management at the city of Kushiro, which lies on the Pacific Coast. He says, \"We hope to review our current earthquake and tsunami measures and take action.\"\n\nThe latest projection was based on deposits of sand and other materials carried ashore by major tsunamis in the past.\n\nEven before the March 11 quake six years ago, deposits from previous tsunamis were found along the coast of northeastern Japan. But those findings weren't incorporated into disaster preparedness measures. They were included in the latest evaluation.\n\nThe panel has been reviewing its estimates of mega-quakes along trenches and troughs. The one concerning the Chishima Trench is the third such review.\n\nIn 2013, the panel said there was a 60 to 70 percent chance of a mega-quake between magnitude 8 and 9 hitting the Nankai Trough in the Pacific in the next 30 years.\n\nExpert calls for preparing against all possibilities\n\nTohoku University professor Fumihiko Imamura stresses the need to eliminate unanticipated risks when preparing for massive earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nImamura says various studies show that if a huge quake occurs in the Chishima Trench, there is a strong chance of tsunamis higher than 20 meters, similar to those in March 2011, hitting the shores of Hokkaido. He adds that tsunamis may also hit the shores of northern Tohoku in such a case.\n\nImamura says the government panel's analysis of the Chishima Trench suggests that the possibility of such disasters hitting Hokkaido is more imminent than previously thought.\n\nHe says the government projections are the result of nationwide scientific efforts to eliminate unanticipated risks, taking lessons from the March 2011 disaster.\n\nThe government also plans to release predictions on the heights of tsunamis, and the time it'll take for the waves to reach the coasts.\n\nImamura says he wants municipalities to make full use of such data and make concrete evacuation plans to save lives.\n\nHe says not only regional governments but also residents should think intently about specific problems that may arise in disaster situations. These include how effective cars will be during such events, and how to prepare evacuation shelters."}, {"title": "Northern Territories: Shared experiences suggest a way forward", "url": "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/nhknewsline/backstories/northernterritorieswish/", "content": "February 7th each year marks Japan's \"Northern Territories Day\" to highlight four Russian-held islands that are claimed by Japan.

As the former residents grow older -- their average age is 84 -- the movement is being passed down to younger generations.\n\nSo near, yet so far\n\nSakiko Suzuki, 80, was born in Shibetoro Village on Etorofu Island, one of the four Russian-held islands. She now lives in Nemuro City in eastern Hokkaido. From its shores, she can clearly see some of the islands that make up the Northern Territories.\n\nSoviet invasion\n\nOn August 9th, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan, ignoring the Neutrality Treaty between the two countries. In early September, Soviet troops invaded the islands, including Etorofu, where the Suzukis lived at the time.\n\nSakiko says when she heard the sound of Soviet soldiers approaching on horses, she was terrified. She remembers that the soldiers, carrying bayonets, stormed into her house without bothering to take their shoes off. They took watches, fountain pens and other valuables and shoved them into their pockets.\n\nForced to leave home\n\nSakiko was among the more than 17,000 Japanese people who lived on the islands at the time. Some of the residents fled, while others stayed. The Suzuki family was among the latter and spent three years living alongside the Russians.\n\nBut, in 1948, the family was forced to leave by ship carrying nothing but small bags of belongings. Sakiko was sent to a concentration camp at Maoka, now called Kholmsk, on Sakhalin.\n\nShe recalls the extreme hardships she encountered there. She had to drink contaminated water, and many children fell sick because of malnutrition. Sakiko says: \"I saw people dying one after another. A truck would come every few days to pick up the bodies, but no one knew where they were buried. They were treated like trash.\"\n\nAfter about a month in Sakhalin, Sakiko returned to Hokkaido.\n\nDecades later, a brief return\n\nHowever, it was not until 1990, more than four decades later, that Sakiko was able to travel to her homeland. For the first time, former residents of Etorofu were allowed to visit their ancestors' graves. She visited the graveyards with her former neighbors, only to see them destroyed, with gravestones scattered everywhere. A Russian guide told her that many gravestones had been used to build new houses, while others remained only because they were not used for construction.\n\nSakiko says: \"Upon hearing that, my anger peaked. No tears or words could express my resentment about that terrible treatment. Everyone there visiting the family graves with me fell silent.\"\n\nGraves in Etorofu\n\nOvercoming resentment\n\nSakiko says it wasn't easy for her to open up to Russians living on the island. But that changed as she continued to visit the Northern Territories and communicate with local Russians on visa-free exchange programs between the two countries.\n\nWhen she visited one of the Russian families who lived on Etorofu Island, a young man asked her, \"Don't the former Japanese residents hate Russians like us who live here?\" The man avoided eye contact as he spoke, but she was struck by his bravery.\n\nSakiko says: \"I was grateful for the mere fact that there are some Russians who care about us. I felt the need to open up and talk about my feelings.\" She told him what had happened to her family grave, adding, \"I have never experienced anything sadder than this.\"\n\nSakiko says the young man's mother said Russians also worship their ancestors and that she was ashamed to hear this. The woman apologized with tears in her eyes.\n\nSakiko says she realized the sincerity of those remarks and couldn't hold back her tears either. She says, \"The feeling of resentment I had held onto for such a long time evaporated.\"\n\nSharing her experiences\n\nThe experience prompted Sakiko to start sharing with younger generations how her family was forced to leave the island. She is hoping that can add momentum to the campaign for the return of the islands. Her audience consists of not only Japanese people, but also Russians visiting Nemuro City from the islands.\n\nParts of Sakiko's story are painful for Russians to hear, and some of them would leave before she finished her story. But she continued in the belief that it's important to deepen mutual understanding.\n\nSakiko says: \"I'm thrilled when I'm able to get my message across to young Japanese and Russians. It motivates me a lot when they send letters describing how they felt. I read them over and over. I'm also encouraged to know that young people will pass on what I tell them to future generations. So I'm determined to do everything I can to continue speaking about my experiences.\" She treasures the responses from young people who've heard her story.\n\nSakiko Suzuki shares her experiences\n\nLearning Russian\n\nAs Sakiko shared her experiences, she realized the Russians seemed to be more interested in her story when she introduced herself in their language. So she began learning Russian for the first time at the age of 70. She enjoys speaking to the Russians living on the islands using what she's learned. As she built a rapport with them, some began to share the latest news from the islands without her asking.\n\nSakiko Suzuki learned Russian to communicate with the people currently living on the islands.\n\nLetter to Putin\n\nSakiko decided to put her newly acquired skills to good use by writing a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin. She gave it to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe when she and former residents of the islands met with him prior to his summit with Putin. Abe agreed to pass on the letter, and Sakiko later learned that Putin had read it.\n\nSakiko Suzuki meets with Abe on December 12th, 2016.\n\nIn her letter to Putin, Sakiko made a proposal. She mentioned a salmon hatchery in her hometown, Shibetoro Village on Etorofu Island. The hatchery was built by Japanese islanders in 1929, but the Russians took over the business and ran it until 2002.\n\nSakiko's father told her that at the hatchery, Japanese and Russian residents had worked side by side after the invasion. He said the Japanese had taught the Russians how to hatch eggs, while the Russians had taught their Japanese coworkers the Russian method for processing salmon roe. He said the Japanese and Russian workers had helped each other. In her letter to Putin, she shared the story and proposed that Japanese and Russians build a facility in which they can cooperate as they did at the hatchery.\n\nSakiko says she thought Putin wouldn't read the letter if she just asked for the return of the islands. She was determined to use her experiences of living alongside the Russians to solve the territorial issue. She says no matter how hard it was, she thought she should write the letter in Russian so Putin would understand its contents.\n\nThe salmon hatchery on Etorofu Island.\n\nJapan-Russia negotiations\n\nNegotiations between Japan and Russia have failed to produce tangible results. At a summit in Singapore in November 2018, Abe and Putin agreed to accelerate talks towards a peace treaty based on a 1956 joint declaration. The declaration stipulates that Moscow will hand over Habomai and Shikotan to Japan after the conclusion of a peace treaty. But there's no mention of Etorofu, Sakiko's birthplace, or Kunashiri.\n\nJapan-Russia summit in Singapore in November 2018.\n\nSakiko says she's always wanted all four islands to be returned to Japan and she still feels that way. The leaders of Japan and Russia met again in January this year, but the two sides remained far apart. The Russian side reiterated that Moscow will not sign a peace treaty unless Japan recognizes Russian sovereignty over the islands. Japan has maintained its official stance.\n\nSakiko fears that the talks might stall. She says: \"I am getting older each day. So, to be honest, it's really tough. I've been working for the return of the islands all these years, but this is the hardest it's been. We feel uneasy but all we can do right now is to wait for a positive result.\"\n\nSakiko Suzuki looks out at the Habomai Islands.\n\nPassing on the torch of hope\n\nSakiko pins her hope on her daughter, Takako Yamashita, who's 55. Yamashita never lived in the islands, but she delivered a speech at this year's National Rally calling for the return of all four as a second-generation former islander.\n\nIn her speech she said, \"My mother, who was ten when she was forced to leave the islands with her family, is now 80. Too many years have passed. Former residents of the islands have strong feelings towards their hometowns. They say not a day goes by without thinking about the time they spent on the islands. I only hope that a day will soon come when we can all stand on the beach of Shibetoro Village together, filled with joy, and shout, 'We're home!' To make that happen, I'd like to ask for your cooperation.\" Her mother sat in the front row, listening as tears filled her eyes.\n\nTakako Yamashita at the National Rally.\n\nAfter the speech, Yamashita said that her mother's age means little time is left to resolve the issue. She pledged to make every effort to make the campaign a success so the islands are returned as soon as possible.\n\nSakiko says she was moved by her daughter's speech and was relieved to confirm that she had fully understood her mission. She says she wants her to take over when she is gone.\n\nTakako Yamashita plays \"Furusato\" on the piano.\n\nYamashita, who is a music teacher, played \"Furusato (Hometown)\" on the piano when I visited her home in Sapporo. She played powerfully, as if to show the strength of her resolve to carry on what her mother began.\n\nFormer islanders sing this song at the end of each visit, as they look out from their boats at their hometown disappearing into the distance. Many say they want to live alongside the Russians, rather than force them out of the islands. I couldn't help but hope that a day will come when Japanese and Russians can sing together in a shared home in the islands."}]}, {"actual_city": "Panguna, Papua New Guinea", "occurence_timestamp": 1551493039250, "occurence_date": "02 Mar 2019", "magnitude": 5.5, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Sat, 16 Feb 12:47:58 UTC / BOUGAINVILLE REGION, P.N.G.

The High Commissioner was joined by Minister for Forests the Hon Douglas Tomuriesa MP (Member for Kiriwina-Goodenough) as well as representatives from the National Department of Health, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Milne Bay Provincial Health Authority Chair Peter Neville and CEO Billy Naidi and members of the district administration.\n\nA new CHP at Sinaketa will serve more than 12,000 people living on the island of Kiriwina, and surrounding islands including Kitava, Muwo and Vakuta. A new CHP at Kaduwaga will cater for more than 3,000 people in the surrounding islands located to the west of Kiriwina. These are the last of four CHPs to be completed in Milne Bay under the Rural Primary Health Service Delivery Project (RPHSDP), at a cost of K4.5million each. Two others; Bubuleta and Gurney were opened in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe RPHSDP supports the Government of Papua New Guinea\u2019s long-term vision to transform the health system. Especially to improve the health of the rural population by providing efficient and high-quality health services. The new CHPs include a delivery and post-natal room, toilets and washing facilities, and medical waste management facilities, as well as new staff housing.\n\nThe RPHSDP is supported by Australia as the major contributor under the Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership, ADB, OPEC Fund for International Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Health Organisation. While in Kiriwina-Goodenough, the High Commissioner joined Minister Tomuriesa in addressing staff and students at Kiriwina High School, highlighting the value of education and reiterating Australia\u2019s commitment to an enduring partnership with Papua New Guinea, across all regions of the country.\n\nThe High Commissioner also completed a number of activities in the Milne Bay provincial capital of Alotau, including officially launching the new Alotau Chapter of the PNG Australia Awards Alumni Association and undertaking a tour of exhibits at the Massim Museum and Cultural Centre, which has recently been relocated and refurbished thanks to the efforts of local volunteers and artists.\n\nSource: The Australian High Commission in PNG"}]}, {"actual_city": "Duran, Ecuador", "occurence_timestamp": 1550832040250, "occurence_date": "22 Feb 2019", "magnitude": 5.5, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.5 earthquake on Fri, 22 Feb 10:40:40 UTC / NEAR COAST OF ECUADOR - 73 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2243936/M5-Fri-22-Feb-NEAR-COAST-OF-ECUADOR.html", "content": "Moderate mag. 5.5 earthquake - NEAR COAST OF ECUADOR on Friday, 22 February 2019\n\nHypocenter depth recalculated from 82.0 to 80.0 km.\n\nsubmit a short \"I felt it\" report.\n\nYou can use your GPS or device location as well to show where you were during the earthquake. - thank you.

That was followed by another one with the same magnitude at 13.58 p.m. on the same day, and the latest major quake occurred in Ayvac\u0131k on Feb. 12 with the same magnitude, according to AFAD.A number of buildings in the region were damaged and many locals settled in tent cities set up near the village of Yukar\u0131k\u00f6y, which was severely damaged by the quakes.AFAD and the Turkish Red Crescent are currently setting up a container city for victims in the area.Schools in the district were also canceled for a week due to the earthquakes.The \u00c7anakkale Governor\u2019s Office announced on Feb. 7 that eight people were injured in the first quake on Feb. 6, five of whom were discharged from hospital and three of whom were in a stable condition.Professor Haluk \u00d6zener, the head of the Kandilli Observatory and the Earthquake Research Institute, said the quakes were \u201cunsurprising\u201d and noted that earthquakes between the 5 and 5.5 magnitude range were \u201cnatural\u201d for the region.Prof. Dr. \u00d6vg\u00fcn Ercan, an academic at the Faculty of Mines at Istanbul Technical University, warned about another wave of earthquakes, saying a major earthquake was expected \u201cwithin the next 15 to 20 days.\u201d\u201cFaultlines in the region cannot discharge their tension. So an earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6 are expected within the next 15 to 20 days,\u201d Ercan said.Environment Minister Mehmet \u00d6zhaseki issued warnings following the recent earthquakes in \u00c7anakkale and Malatya, reminding them that Turkey stood on active fault lines.\u201cSome 42 percent of territory in Turkey is at risk of earthquakes. We need to act by keeping this reality in mind. We should build safe buildings on stable bases,\u201d \u00d6zhaseki said.He also announced that 500,000 buildings would be constructed in 2018 as part of urban transformation pilot projects aiming to build safe and secure buildings."}]}, {"actual_city": "Kota Ternate, Indonesia", "occurence_timestamp": 1550621438760, "occurence_date": "20 Feb 2019", "magnitude": 5.5, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.5 earthquake on Wed, 20 Feb 00:10:41 UTC / Northern Molucca Sea (Indonesia) - 5 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2242327/M5-Wed-20-Feb-Northern-Molucca-Sea-Indonesia.html", "content": "Moderate mag. 5.5 earthquake - Northern Molucca Sea (Indonesia) on Wednesday, 20 February 2019\n\nFeb 20 00:18: Magnitude recalculated from 5.6 to 5.4.\n\nHypocenter depth recalculated from 66.0 to 62.0 km.\n\nFeb 20 00:19: Magnitude recalculated from 5.4 to 5.5.\n\nHypocenter depth recalculated from 62.0 to 61.0 km.\n\nI felt this quake\n\nMagnitude: 5.5\n\nDepth: 61.0 km\n\nEpicenter latitude / longitude: 0.75\u00b0N / 126.2\u00b0E (Indonesia)\n\nNearest volcano:\n\nPrimary data source:\n\nEstimated released energy: 1.1*10^13 J (3.12 GWh / 2682 tons of TNT / 0.2 atomic bombs equivalent) [ Date & time: Wed, 20 Feb 00:10:41 UTCMagnitude: 5.5Depth: 61.0 kmEpicenter latitude / longitude: 0.75\u00b0N / 126.2\u00b0ENearest volcano: Gamalama (125 km)Primary data source: GFZ Estimated released energy: 1.1*10^13 J (3.12 GWh / 2682 tons of TNT / 0.2 atomic bombs equivalent) [ learn more\n\nsubmit a short \"I felt it\" report.\n\nYou can use your GPS or device location as well to show where you were during the earthquake. - thank you.

The affected area is sparsely populated, with a dispersed population living in remote, rural communities. There are no major urban areas in the immediate vicinity although there is a gas pipeline in the area. There were some minor landslides following the earthquake, but as of 26 February no damage to infrastructure or homes has been reported. (OCHA, 26 Feb 2018)\n\nAt 15.17 UTC on 26 February 2018, a major aftershock with a magnitude of 6.2 M occurred in the Southern Highlands province close to the location of the 7.5 M earthquake of 25 February. According to media, as of 27 February, at least 30 people have been killed and 300 have been injured, several houses have been buried due to landslides in the worst affected areas of Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. The search and rescue operations are still ongoing and the death toll is expected to rise. For the time being, local authorities have not requested international support. (ECHO, 27 Feb 2018)\n\nOn 1 Mar, an immediate State of Emergency has been declared for Highlands Earthquake Disaster areas in Hela, Southern Highlands, Western and Enga Provinces to expedite the restoration of essential public services. PNG government approved K450 million for relief operations and to restore services, as well as the formation of an Emergency Disaster Restoration Team and the Establishment of a Restoration Authority to manage long-term reconstruction efforts over a 4-year period. (Govt. PNG, 1 Mar 2018)\n\nAerial assessments have shown significant damage and large landslides, and it is estimated that up to 465,000 people may have been affected by the disaster. An estimated 247,000 people are likely to require immediate assistance. Water is reported to be scarce in affected areas due to damage to storage facilities and water sources. One of the main health facilities in the affected area, Mendi hospital, is reportedly experiencing disruption to both water and power supplies. (OCHA, 5 Mar 2018)\n\nA strong aftershock with a magnitude of 6.7 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in the Western province on 6 March at 14.13 UTC, approximately 30 km south-east of the major 7.5 M earthquake of 25 February. According to media, as of 7 March at 8.00 UTC, at least 18 people have been killed by the 6.7 M earthquake (ECHO, 7 Mar 2018).\n\nThe Government, private companies and humanitarian partners have focused initial relief efforts on communities in the worst-hit seven LLGs in Hela and Southern Highlands provinces. Private companies and bilateral partners, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, play a critical role in the early phase of the response. They work closely with UN agencies, NGOs, CSO, FBOs and the Red Cross. Humanitarian partners have provided food to over 34,400 people in Nipa Kutubu LLG and Komo Magarima LLG. Up to 54,260 households are estimated to be in need of emergency shelter. To date, 100 households in Mount Bosavi LLG and another 100 households in Para/Moro have received shelter equipment. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 11 Mar 2018).\n\nOn 27 March 2018, the Parliament passed two bills formalizing the State of Emergency in earthquake-affected areas and establishing a Restoration Authority for the affected provinces. The first bill formalised the State of Emergency initially declared by Prime Minister on 2 March 2018, while the second establishes the WESH Restoration Authority, covering Western, Enga, Southern Highlands, and Hela, as well as parts of West Sepik and Gulf provinces...On 28 March, the Disaster Management Team (DMT) issued its initial earthquake response plan, which focuses on providing life-saving assistance and helping to re-establish basic services for 270,000 people in need of immediate assistance due to the 26 February 2018 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks and landslides...It calls for US$ 62 million to support urgent action in seven areas, including Food Security; Health and Nutrition; Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; Shelter; Protection; Education; and Logistics Coordination. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 29 Mar 2018)\n\nHumanitarian operations in and around Tari, provincial capital of Hela province, have been suspended due to the rise in tension and outbreak of inter-communal fighting since 28 March. US$ 43 million has been mobilized from the private sector for earthquake response and recovery, primarily as contributions to government efforts. (PNG Disaster Management Team, 5 Apr 2018)\n\nFollowing a 7.5 magnitude earthquake which hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and affected an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces, assessment teams visited 38 displacement sites in the Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of PNG between 10\u201327 March 2018. Data was collected from key informants including councilors, village leaders, church leaders, teachers and healthcare workers.\n\nThe assessments showed that the most urgent needs of the displaced populations were water and shelter first and foremost, as well as kitchen utensils and food. Displacement sites such as Lau, Timu and Levani located in Hela Province are extremely isolated and were identified to be in urgent need of food rations following the destruction of food gardens and the limited food supply available. Many of the affected populations also suffer from continued trauma as aftershocks of the earthquake continue to hit the region. (IOM, 20 Apr 2018)\n\nThe key social infrastructure assessment, primarily focusing on health and education facilities, concluded that total estimated cost of rehabilitating in Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces is approximately USD 105 million. Result of a mobile Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (mVAM) survey, conducted during 22 March to 12 April 2018, indicated that 14 per cent of 1,534 households contacted in affected areas were displaced. Nine of 31 households in Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people. (Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 7 May 2018)\n\nAs of 28 May 2018, 11,761 households (approximately 58,300 people) remain displaced, of which 1,672 households are staying in eleven care centres while 10,089 households are staying with host communities according to the latest figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June. (Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 28 May 2018)\n\nThe access to remote locations and communication remains a significant challenge faced by all actors. As violent clashes in some communities are frequent, the restriction of movement has delayed, or prevented, aid from reaching certain locations. As of 29 May, humanitarian organizations temporarily have suspended operations in Hela province due to several security incidents. Serious security concerns in some areas continue to hamper intervention. (IFRC, 29 May 2018).\n\nEarthquake response activities in the Southern Highlands Province have been suspended after an outbreak of violence in the provincial capital, Mendi. Following the result of a national court decision to dismiss an election petition in favour of the incumbent Governor, protestors attacked multiple public and private buildings. On 14 June, the PNG Prime Minister declared a State of Emergency in Southern Highlands Province. Relief activities in areas of the Southern Highlands Province not affected by the violence are ongoing.

A government taskforce on earthquake research held an extraordinary meeting on Thursday evening. Members discussed what may have caused the quake. They concluded that it was unrelated to a nearby fault zone. Experts warn that an inland quake of the same level could occur away from an active fault anywhere in Japan.\n\nExperts discuss the mechanism\n\nKei Katsumata, a seismologist at Hokkaido University, says an active fault called the Ishikari Teichi To-en zone is located near the epicenter, but he expressed doubt about a direct link between the fault and the quake. \"The epicenter was 40 kilometers underground, while the fault is about 10 kilometers deep,\" Katsumata pointed out.\n\nHe says Thursday's magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurred in an area where stress is known to accumulate underground. A strong earthquake occurred there in July of last year.\n\nKatsumata says that the earthquake may have been caused by pressure that built up in the area surrounding the fault. There's constant upward pressure toward the nearby Hidaka Mountain Range there. He warned, \"Pent-up pressure may not necessarily be released in one earthquake, and that over the next week or so, the area may have several more earthquakes just as powerful as the one on Thursday.\"\n\nMembers of the government's task force also discussed whether Thursday's quake originated in the fault zone. But they concluded it did not, given the distance from the fault zone to the epicenter. The leader of the task force team, University of Tokyo Professor Naoshi Hirata, warns that \"More inland quakes, both close and far from the active fault, could occur as a result of Thursday's quake.\" He says he wants people to know strong earthquakes can occur in any inland part of Japan regardless of whether there is an active fault. \"A maximum-level quake could hit,\" he said.\n\nRescue work continues over night\n\nRescuers are searching for missing people around the clock in the town of Atsuma, near the epicenter.\n\nThe quake measured the strongest possible level on Japan's seismic intensity scale in the town, triggering massive landslides over 2 kilometers that wiped out homes. Five people died there and all 26 of the missing people are from this area.\n\nRescuers are digging through rubble and mud in their search for survivors. A platoon leader of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces said they have been working through the night. \"It's hard to find the many people who remain buried. We want to rescue them as quickly as possible.\" A man living nearby said, \"I'm worried about my neighbors. I want rescuers to find them fast.\"\n\nJapanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government is making an all-out effort. \"Police, firefighters, and members of the Self-Defense Forces and Coast Guard are placing top priority on saving lives. Together with the help from outside the prefecture, 22,000 personnel and 75 helicopters are working around the clock,\" he said.\n\nAn expert analyzed footage of the landslides. Hiroyuki Ohno, the head of the Sabo and Landslide Technical Center says the soft surface of the mountains gave way. \"The surface may have contained volcanic ash, making it prone to crumbling,\" Ohno said.\n\nHe also says the exposed surface absorbs rainwater, making it even more likely to collapse, so people in the quake-hit areas should be careful of secondary disasters.\n\nThere have been more than 90 aftershocks. Meteorological Agency officials are warning that strong tremors could hit the region again over the coming week.\n\nTo make matters worse, rain is forecast to drench Hokkaido starting on Friday. Officials are warning it may trigger further landslides.\n\nEvacuees spend night at shelters\n\nThousands of people have evacuated to shelters set up throughout the prefecture. Officials have issued requests to supermarkets and convenience stores for supplies of food and water because emergency provisions are running low.\n\nEvacuees were comforted by the hot meals they were served in the morning.\n\nA person at the shelter in Atsuma said, \"I couldn't sleep last night as my relative is still missing in the mud and there have been so many tremors.\"\n\nAnother person at the shelter described how hard the night was. \"I feel safer here. My home is dark because of the blackout, and it's scary. It's been a while since I had food like this, because I couldn't eat anything last night,\" she said.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nStrong Earthquake Hits Hokkaido\n\nWhat Is the Probability of a Mega-quake Striking Japan in the Future?\n\nThree Fault Zones May Have Been Involved in Osaka Quake"}, {"title": "Powerful quakes more likely to hit Hokkaido, Pacific coast", "url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/06/a6d1d0cccb58-powerful-quakes-more-likely-to-hit-hokkaido-pacific-coast.html", "content": "KYODO NEWS - Jun 26, 2018 - 14:41 | All, Lifestyle\n\nThe government released this year's earthquake probability map of Japan on Tuesday, showing an increased likelihood of strong earthquakes occurring within the next 30 years across a wide area of the Pacific coast including parts of Hokkaido.\n\nThe map showed that Kushiro in Hokkaido saw a sharp increase in the probability of a powerful earthquake, measuring lower 6 or stronger on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7, in the next 30 years, jumping 22 percentage points to 69 percent.\n\nThe sharp rise reflected research suggesting major earthquakes accompanying massive tsunami have repeatedly occurred along Chishima trench off eastern Hokkaido in the past.\n\nElsewhere in Hokkaido, the likelihood rose 15 percentage points in both Nemuro and Hidaka to 78 percent and 70 percent, respectively.\n\nThe most recent major quake hitting Japan's Pacific coast area occurred in March 2011. The magnitude-9.0 quake brought a huge tsunami to northeastern coastal regions, leaving over 18,000 people dead or presumed dead.\n\nMore recently, quakes registering lower 6 or higher have occurred in the southwestern region centering on Kumamoto in April 2016, the western prefecture of Tottori in October 2016 and Osaka in June this year.\n\nThe probability as of Jan. 1 remained high in the greater Tokyo region, Shizuoka in central Japan, parts of the western region of Shikoku and the Kinki region which includes Osaka.\n\nIn a quake with an intensity of lower 6, it is difficult for people to keep standing, and furniture would move or topple over. Older wooden buildings with low quake resistance could collapse.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the fact that an earthquake can strike anywhere,\" said science minister Yoshimasa Hayashi overseeing a panel on earthquake surveys, while urging people to take necessary measures to minimize damage.\n\nIn the Kanto region around Tokyo, where many crustal plates overlap, Chiba had the highest probability among Japanese cities at 85 percent, followed by 82 percent for Yokohama near the Sagamihara Trough, and 81 percent for Mito, both a 1 percentage point increase from the year before.\n\nShizuoka stood at 70 percent, up 1 percentage point from the year before as the city could be hit by a major earthquake along the Nankai Trough that extends southwest from the Pacific Coast. The evaluation of the Nankai Trough also left the probability for Nagoya at 46 percent and Wakayama at 58 percent, according to the report.\n\nThe probability of a major earthquake occurring in the Nankai Trough has been rising every year as it is assumed to occur in a cycle and a major earthquake last occurred there in 1946.\n\nAll four prefectures in the Shikoku region saw the probability rise by 1 to 2 percentage points from the previous year as experts re-evaluated the risks posed by the massive active fault zone along the median tectonic line stretching over the Kinki, Shikoku and Kyushu regions. The city of Kochi marked 75 percent probability.\n\nA number of cities in the Kinki region also have high chances of over 50 percent as the western Japan region has a number of active faults and has large plain fields prone to tremors, the panel said.\n\nNaoshi Hirata, who heads the government panel that compiled the latest report, urged people to check if their homes, offices and local buildings have sufficient quake resistance and to reinforce the structures if necessary.\n\n\"There is no place with zero probability of having an earthquake with an intensity of lower 6 or greater,\" he said.\n\nThe latest estimates are available on the website of the National Research Institute of Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, allowing visitors to check on probabilities by address.\n\nAs Japan is prone to earthquakes, the government has been releasing the map almost annually since 2005 to help residents, firms and municipalities prepare for major earthquakes."}, {"title": "Northern Japan 'at Risk of Huge Quake'", "url": "https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/nhknewsline/backstories/northernjapanatriskofhugequake/", "content": "Backstories - the facts behind the news\n\nIn Japan, there are growing concerns about a powerful earthquake hitting the country's north. Experts predict an 8.8 magnitude quake could occur off the island of Hokkaido sometime in the next three decades.\n\nOn December 19th, a government panel released its projections of the probability and scale of quakes that might happen along the Chishima Trench.\n\nMassive earthquakes have struck the area at intervals of about 350 years. The last one was 400 years ago.\n\nThe panel's members say the probability of such a quake in the next 30 years is 7 to 40 percent.\n\nThe head of the panel, University of Tokyo professor Naoshi Hirata, says, \"A quake like the March 2011 temblor off northeastern Japan could happen. We want people to remember that a tsunami occurs when a big quake strikes off the coast.\"\n\nRegional officials are concerned with the projections. Hokkaido prefectural official Hiroki Mori says, \"We take the evaluation very seriously. We always have to be prepared for a possible quake.\"\n\nThe Chishima Trench has been the location of numerous quakes\n\nThere was one off the Nemuro peninsula in 1973. In 2003, a magnitude 8.0 quake struck just off Tokachi, causing a tsunami of four meters hit the town of Erimo.\n\nThe latest analysis by the panel estimates the quake zone to be in areas off Tokachi and Nemuro, and off the islands of Shikotan and Etorofu.\n\nThe report also warns that there is a high chance of an imminent mega-quake that will trigger large tsunamis off eastern Hokkaido.\n\nAkio Nakayama is in charge of crisis management at the city of Kushiro, which lies on the Pacific Coast. He says, \"We hope to review our current earthquake and tsunami measures and take action.\"\n\nThe latest projection was based on deposits of sand and other materials carried ashore by major tsunamis in the past.\n\nEven before the March 11 quake six years ago, deposits from previous tsunamis were found along the coast of northeastern Japan. But those findings weren't incorporated into disaster preparedness measures. They were included in the latest evaluation.\n\nThe panel has been reviewing its estimates of mega-quakes along trenches and troughs. The one concerning the Chishima Trench is the third such review.\n\nIn 2013, the panel said there was a 60 to 70 percent chance of a mega-quake between magnitude 8 and 9 hitting the Nankai Trough in the Pacific in the next 30 years.\n\nExpert calls for preparing against all possibilities\n\nTohoku University professor Fumihiko Imamura stresses the need to eliminate unanticipated risks when preparing for massive earthquakes and tsunamis.\n\nImamura says various studies show that if a huge quake occurs in the Chishima Trench, there is a strong chance of tsunamis higher than 20 meters, similar to those in March 2011, hitting the shores of Hokkaido. He adds that tsunamis may also hit the shores of northern Tohoku in such a case.\n\nImamura says the government panel's analysis of the Chishima Trench suggests that the possibility of such disasters hitting Hokkaido is more imminent than previously thought.\n\nHe says the government projections are the result of nationwide scientific efforts to eliminate unanticipated risks, taking lessons from the March 2011 disaster.\n\nThe government also plans to release predictions on the heights of tsunamis, and the time it'll take for the waves to reach the coasts.\n\nImamura says he wants municipalities to make full use of such data and make concrete evacuation plans to save lives.\n\nHe says not only regional governments but also residents should think intently about specific problems that may arise in disaster situations. These include how effective cars will be during such events, and how to prepare evacuation shelters."}]}, {"actual_city": "Santa Cruz das Flores, Portugal", "occurence_timestamp": 1550299555530, "occurence_date": "16 Feb 2019", "magnitude": 5.3, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.3 earthquake on Sat, 16 Feb 06:45:55 UTC / 262km NE of Santa Cruz das Flores, Portugal - 3 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2240249/M5-Sat-16-Feb-262km-NE-of-Santa-Cruz-das-Flores-Portugal.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

It can be very disconcerting.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a phantom earthquake\n\nFor one, it could be an aftershock. Just minutes after the first 5.1 magnitude earthquake in Oklahoma on Saturday, a 3.9 earthquake struck.\n\n\u201cEarthquake sickness\u201d is also different from a phantom quake: it is something people feel after an earthquake like motion sickness from a boat even after a person is on dry land. \u201cEarthquake sickness\u201d is a result of actual earth shaking that just occurred. (There also may be \u2018phantom earthquakes\u2019 between the actual earthquake and the aftershock \u2013 scientists are studying this \u2013 but they happen near the moment of the actual earthquake itself, not days or months later.)\n\nSHARE COPY LINK (Oliver Morrison/The Wichita Eagle)\n\nSome people say that they can predict earthquakes because, for example, their ears begin to ring before earthquakes strike. But the United States Geological Survey said, though it can\u2019t be disproved, people say they predict a lot of false earthquakes much more frequently than they actually predict real ones.\n\nOn the other hand the USGS claims that they receive false earthquake reports for \u201csonic booms, trucks, explosions, mine blasts, and other events, thinking they were earthquakes.\u201d\n\nEven the best geologists in the world, sometimes experience phantom quakes when their machinery stops functioning properly: last year earthquakes in Alaska set off sensors in California, which interpreted the far-away shaking as a nearby earthquake.\n\nWhy you felt the earthquake and another person close by didn\u2019t\n\nThe reason you didn\u2019t feel the earthquake could be that you were on the ground floor, rather than higher up in a building, where they are felt more acutely, or because you were on a roller-coaster or elevator, in a car, the shower or even inside a cave.\n\nThe reason you could be feeling an earthquake and and another person nearby doesn\u2019t is that the kind of building you are in transmits the shaking more than another type or the soil that your building is built on is looser and more easily shaken.\n\nWhat a real earthquake feels like\n\nThese are what actual earthquakes feel like according to the USGS:\n\n1) A large earthquake nearby will feel like a sudden large jolt followed quickly by more strong shaking that may last a few seconds or up to a couple of minutes if it\u2019s a rare great event. The shaking will feel violent and it will be difficult to stand up. The contents of your house will be a mess.\n\n2) A large earthquake far away will feel like a gentle bump followed several seconds later by stronger rolling and shaking that may feel like sharp shaking for a little while.\n\n3) A small earthquake nearby will feel like a small sharp jolt followed by a few stronger sharp shakes that pass quickly.\n\n4) A small earthquake far away will probably not be felt at all, but if you do feel it, it will be a subtle gentle shake or two that is easier to feel if you\u2019re still and sitting down."}]}, {"actual_city": "Tarragona, Philippines", "occurence_timestamp": 1550247654720, "occurence_date": "15 Feb 2019", "magnitude": 5.1, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.0 earthquake on Fri, 15 Feb 16:20:55 UTC / Mindanao, Philippines - 5 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2239896/M5-Fri-15-Feb-Mindanao-Philippines.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

That's about 15 miles south-southeast of Tinian. Yutu is moving northwest at 13 mph. The eye of Yutu will pass over Tinian over the next couple hours. Maximum sustained winds have increased to 180 mph. Super Typhoon Yutu is a very dangerous Category 5 storm.\n\nTyphoon force winds extend outward from the center up to 85 miles. Tropical storm force winds extend outward from the center up to 240 miles to the northeast and up to 205 miles elsewhere.\n\nShortly before the NOAA-20 satellite overpass on Oct. 23 (EDT) at 11:51 a.m. EDT (1551 UTC), Super typhoon Yutu hit Tinian island, one of the three principle islands of the Northern Mariana Islands, just south of Sapian and a US Commonwealth.

Coastal inundation of 15 to 20 feet is possible on windward exposures. Once Yutu passes to the west of the Mariana Islands...west and southwest swell will build with surf rising to 12 to 16 feet along west facing reefs. Coastal inundation of 5 to 7 feet is possible on west facing exposures. Surf will generate deadly rip currents.\n\nA flash flood warning remains in effect for the entire area.

However, it is still too early to know if Yutu would strike any of these locations or it would recurve northeastwards towards the sea.\n\nThe storm rapidly intensified from a Category 1 to Category 5 super typhoon in the 24 hours ending 4 PM Wednesday local time. The maximum wind speed around the eye of the storm remains at 280 kmph.\n\nTyphoon warnings remain in effect for the islands of Saipan, Tinian and Rota, and a tropical storm warning continues for the far northern islands of Alamagan, Pagan and Agrihan.\n\nYutu will weaken gradually as it moves west-northwestward into the Philippine Sea, however would remain a strong Category 3 or 4 typhoons through Monday.\n\nGusty winds will lash Saipan, Tinian and Rota through late Thursday morning as per local time. A storm surge of 5 or more feet is expected, however it would gradually subside through Thursday. High surf and rip currents are expected over the Marianas on Thursday evening.\n\nAbout 50 to 130 mm of rainfall is expected triggering flash floods and landslides in the higher terrains.

Here are a few facts for your enjoyment.\n\n1. They\u2019ve a reputation for bravery \u2013 and baring their bottoms\n\nNick Squires, writing for Telegraph Travel, explains: \u201cUntil independence in 1980, Vanuatu was an Anglo-French colony known as the New Hebrides - the name coined by Captain Cook, who explored the archipelago in 1774.\n\n\u201cOn one island, fearing imminent attack by up to 1,000 tribesmen, he ordered the ship's cannons and muskets to be trained on the crowd. The locals were not intimidated. \u2018One fellow shewed us his backside in such a manner that it wasn't necessary to have an interpreter to explain his meaning,\u2019 Cook wrote testily in his log.\u201d\n\n2. Cannibalism was practiced until relatively recently\n\n\u201cThe islanders developed a reputation as fearsome cannibals,\u201d adds Squires. \u201cIn 1839 the first two British missionaries to be dispatched from the London Missionary Society were promptly killed and eaten on Martyrs' Island, now known as Erromango.\u201d\n\nAfter a visit in 2008 our writer was even offered a lesson in how best to cook a human.\n\n\"First, our ancestors would dig a hole in the ground,\" a villager, Berna Kambai, told him. \"They'd put hot stones in the hole, then cut up the person into pieces and put those on top. They'd add in some yams and taro, put in some more hot rocks, and cover it all over with banana leaves to keep the steam in.\"\n\nStandard baking time was three to five hours, apparently, and the chief of the village always got to eat the victim's head.\n\nMost anthropologists agree that Vanuatu's last recorded cannibal killing took place as recently as 1969.\n\n3. It\u2019s the world\u2019s most dangerous country\n\nWhen it comes to natural disasters, that it.\n\nThe 2015 World Risk Report, compiled by the United Nations University for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), assigned a risk percentage to a total of 173 countries, based on the chances of experiencing earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts and sea level rises. Number one, with 36.43 per cent, was Vanuatu, ahead of Tonga, Philippines, Guatemala and Bangladesh.\n\n4. There\u2019s a tribe that worships Prince Philip\n\n\u201cThe Prince Philip Movement, which these days has its own Facebook page, started with a visit the Queen and Duke made to Vanuatu in 1974,\u201d wrote Paul Chapman for The Telegraph in 2015.\n\n\u201cA warrior named Chief Jack Naiva, who died in 2009, was one of the paddlers of a war canoe that greeted the royal yacht Britannia at the nation's capital, Port Vila. Chief Jack became convinced that Prince Philip was the descendant of a Tanna spiritual ancestor.\n\n\"\u2018I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform,\u2019 Chief Jack is on record as saying. \u2018I knew then that he was the true messiah.\u2019 Prince Philip has since exchanged gifts with the islanders, including sending them a signed portrait of himself.\u201d\n\nThe Messiah, sorry, Prince Philip in Vanuatu Credit: GETTY\n\n5. They invented bungee jumping\n\nWhen the yam crop emerges in early April on Vanuatu\u2019s Pentecost Island, the locals begin to build high wooden towers (around 20 to 30 meters). Once completed, and until about the end of May, village men and boys dive from these rickety structures with vines attached to their ankles. Nanggol, as the ritual is known, is seen as a precursor to bungee jumping and the country has even sought royalties from modern adventure firms for stealing their tradition.\n\nTourists watch the Nanggol ritual Credit: GETTY\n\n6. It\u2019s one of the world\u2019s least visited countries\n\nThe Queen has been there, but she\u2019s part of a tiny minority. Around 95,000 people visit each year, with the arduous journey being one barrier. Should you wish to go, the quickest option takes 33 hours, involves two stops and will cost \u00a31,647 per person, according to Google Flights.\n\nOr else book a cruise. Lines offering voyages around the South Pacific typically call at Vila, the country\u2019s capital.\n\n7. But is hugely reliant on tourism\n\nThose 95,000 annual visitors are very important. In fact, tourism accounts for almost 20 per cent of Vanuatu\u2019s GDP. The other mainstays of the economy are agriculture, cattle, and offshore financial services.\n\nVanuatu needs you Credit: GETTY\n\n8. You can explore a shipwreck\n\n\u201cThe 650-foot USS President Coolidge was a luxury liner that was converted to a troop ship during the Second World War,\u201d says Nick Squires. \u201cIn 1942 it was carrying 5,000 men when it hit two American mines in Santo Harbour, near the dusty colonial outpost of Luganville. The captain managed to ground it on a reef, allowing all but two of its officers and men to wade ashore before the giant vessel slid beneath the waves.\n\n\u201cIt's now one of the most acclaimed wreck dives in the world. Divers encounter trucks, Jeeps, chandeliers, cannons and a swimming pool as they explore it.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Stuart McIntosh (@stuthewookie) on May 21, 2015 at 5:21am PDT\n\n9. And peer inside a volcano\n\nAndrew Boulton, a Telegraph Travel reader, writes: \u201cTanna Island in Vanuatu is home to Mount Yasur, the world\u2019s most accessible active volcano. Ready access to a mountain filled with furious molten rock may not strike you as a good thing, but peeking over the rim of something so violent and beautiful is unique. The drive through the black, steaming ash fields is the most eerie and exhilarating journey you will ever take. And if you stay overnight, the sight, smell and staggering, ethereal rumble of the volcano against the seemingly infinite Pacific night sky is indescribable. One Fijian chap on our expedition tried likening it to laughing in the face of the devil. I can\u2019t see how I could disagree.\u201d\n\nMount Yasur\n\n10. Or spot dugongs\n\nThe majestic dugong, or sea cow, is plentiful in Vanuatu, but endangered in many other parts of the world.\n\nThe majestic dugong Credit: GETTY\n\n11. It\u2019s the world\u2019s fourth happiest country\n\nThe annual Happy Planet Index, released each summer, ranks 140 destinations according to \u201cwhat matters most - sustainable wellbeing for all\u201d. GDP takes a back seat; instead it's all about judging \u201chow well nations are doing at achieving long, happy, sustainable lives\u201d.\n\nAnd Vanuatu, remarkably, comes fourth in the ranking, behind only Costa Rica, Mexico and Colombia.\n\n12. Most of the locals speak English\n\nAccording to David Crystal's book English as a Global Language, there are 45 countries around the world where at least half of the population speak English. Vanuatu is one.\n\n13. But it\u2019s the most linguistically diverse nation on the planet\n\nMore than 100 languages are found in Vanuatu, making it per capita the world's most linguistically diverse country. A curious form of pidgin English called Bislama is also widely spoken. \u201cMi no savee\u201d means \u201cI don't understand\", while a seagull is \u201cpigeon blong solwota\u201d [literally, a saltwater pigeon]. Prince Charles is known as \u201cnambawan [number one] pikinini blong kwin [queen]\u201d.\n\nVanuatu is a popular stop for South Pacific cruises Credit: GETTY\n\n14. Smoking ain\u2019t popular\n\nThe archipelago is one of the 10 most tobacco-free countries on Earth, according to 2014 figures from the World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\n15. And they\u2019re trying to ban junk food\n\nAuthorities in the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu this year pledged to ban imported Western food in an attempt to ward off potential health problems.\n\nTorba province, the northernmost island grouping in the sprawling archipelago, which has a population of just under 10,000 people, mostly subsistence farmers, aims to introduce legislation within two years prohibiting all foreign food, with the aim of becoming an entirely organic region by 2020. In the meantime, tourism bungalows have been ordered to serve guests only locally-sourced, organic produce.\n\n16. This woman is a big fan\n\nTelegraph Travel spoke to Cassie De Pecol last year after she became the fastest person, and the first documented woman, to visit every country in the world. Vanuatu, she said, was among her 10 favourite places. \u201cGo there to meet some of the kindest people in the world,\u201d she advises.

It's very unique,\" said TankerTrackers co-founder Samir Madani.\n\nIt is part of efforts by Iran and its customers to keep oil flowing ahead of a new US embargo set to hit on Monday.\n\n\"Iran has around 30 vessels in the Gulf area, so the past 10 days have been very tricky, but it hasn't slowed us down. We are keeping watch visually,\" said co-founder Lisa Ward.\n\nHuge improvements in commercially available satellite imagery in recent years have allowed firms like TankerTrackers to watch the progress of vessels on a daily basis, where once images would have come only once a week or more.\n\nIran hopes less transparency will allow it to keep selling oil after November 5 when the United States reimposes the last set of sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, which Washington abandoned in May.\n\nBut Joel Hancock, from analysis firm Natixis, said this did not mean their sales would necessarily remain high.\n\n\"The main issue with tanker trackers is they are tracking exports, maybe not sales,\" he said, adding that the ships could just be moving oil to storage facilities in China or elsewhere.\n\nAnother method - used during the last sanctions period between 2010 and 2015 - is to keep oil on huge tankers off the Gulf coast.\n\nTankerTrackers says there are currently six vessels, with a total capacity of 11 million barrels, parked offshore as floating storage containers - freeing up port capacity and allowing for quick deliveries.\n\nAlthough precise figures are rarely available in the notoriously opaque oil market, most analysts say Iran's exports dropped from about 2.5 million barrels per day in April to roughly 1.6 million in October.\n\nCountries with close security and trade ties with the US were quick to cut their purchases - South Korea went almost straight to zero, with Japan and much of Europe close behind.\n\nAlthough the European Union has vowed to create a \"special purpose vehicle\" (SPV) to protect companies buying oil, analysts see little chance that firms will risk US penalties by using it.\n\n\"The SPV is currently dead in the water. It can't handle oil in any serious volume,\" said Henry Rome, a specialist on Iran sanctions for the Washington-based Eurasia Group consultancy.\n\nThe US granted waivers to eight countries but only on condition they make substantial cuts to their purchases.\n\nBut the trickiest customers for the US in its \"maximum pressure\" campaign are the biggest buyers, India and China.\n\n_______________\n\nRead more:\n\nIran's losing game to sell oil may not be the only pain ahead\n\nD-day is looming on Washington's ambitious goal to reduce Iran's oil exports to zero\n\nUS to grant waivers to eight buyers of Iranian crude\n\n_______________\n\nChina, the largest buyer of Iranian oil, has been surprisingly willing to play ball with sanctions so far, in part because it has bigger fish to fry in the form of its ongoing trade war with Washington.\n\nDuring the last sanctions period, China funnelled almost all its Iranian transactions through the Bank of Kunlun, controlled by Chinese state energy group CNPC, which was sanctioned by the US in 2012 but shielded the rest of the sector from penalties.\n\n\"Kunlun was a sacrificial lamb in the past ... but Chinese banks appear to have realised the immense risk and are a lot more cautious,\" said Mr Rome.\n\nUnconfirmed reports suggested that the Bank of Kunlun has been quietly halting transactions with Iran.\n\nBut China is likely to seek new paths to keep the oil flowing, according to Mr Rome.\n\n\"It looks like they'll open another channel, maybe another bank, and keep importing sizeable amounts, but there's still a lot to work out,\" he said.\n\nIndia, another major buyer, will also be looking for mechanisms as they did during the last sanctions period.\n\n\"The difference last time was that sanctions were phased in gradually over a long period,\" said Mr Rome.\n\n\"There's a certain panic this time that they are being required to make very substantial reductions immediately, and also that banking systems are much more intertwined than in the past.\"\n\nEven if Iran can continue to sneak oil out of its ports, it will find it difficult to get the cash into its accounts.\n\n\"Iran is a formidable adversary, well practised in different techniques to keep selling oil and muddle the data, but that won't be a panacea for everything,\" said Mr Rome."}, {"title": "'Economic war' hitting Iran after US sanctions", "url": "https://www.9news.com.au/world/us-sanctions-are-economic-war-iran-leader/2816a727-b47c-42f0-819a-588350d05b02", "content": "Iran's president has described US sanctions imposed on Iran as an economic war being waged on his country and stressed that \"economic war is more difficult than military war\".\n\nHassan Rouhani spoke as he inaugurated the third and final phase of the sprawling Persian Gulf Star refinery built in the Persian Gulf port city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nIran's president has described US sanctions imposed on Iran as an economic war being waged on his country (AAP )\n\nConstruction of the refinery began in 2006 and it now has the capacity of 400,000 barrels a day, which amounts to about 20 per cent of Iran's 2.1 million barrels of daily refining capacity.\n\nRouhani praised the inauguration, saying in a televised speech that it comes despite America's \"imposing the harshest sanctions\" on Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration last year pulled the US out of Iran's nuclear deal with world powers and re-imposed sanction on Iran, targeting its vital oil sector.\n\n\"We have inaugurated huge national projects in this situation,\" Rouhani said at they inauguration, adding that this comes despite efforts by the US, Israel and their allies to increase pressures on Iran.\n\n\u00a9 AAP 2019"}]}, {"actual_city": "General Luna, Philippines", "occurence_timestamp": 1549626907830, "occurence_date": "08 Feb 2019", "magnitude": 5.9, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Fri, 8 Feb 15:28:30 UTC / - 48km ENE of General Luna, Philippines - 49 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2235722/M4-Fri-8-Feb--48km-ENE-of-General-Luna-Philippines.html", "content": "Get our newsletter!\n\n: Excellent information and background for anyone wishing to visit active volcanoes safely and enjoyably.

The volcano, very similar in morphology and activity style to Stromboli in Italy, or Batu Tara in Indonesia, is one of the most active ones in the Pacific and erupts on average every few years.The last confirmed activity took place in 2012.

The eruption consisted of a sudden large vulcanian explosion which lasted 6 minutes and sent a vertical ash column to approx. 4 km height above the volcano and caused light to moderate ash falls in nearby areas to the W and NW.As the last attached photo shows, a collapse of parts of the eruption column caused a pyroclastic flow on the western side.VAAC Darwin reported the plume height to reach 20,000 ft and drifting NE. Sam Ratulangi International Airport in Manado City continues to operate normally.Recordings from from the local volcano observatory shows that there had been a light increase in seismic activity under the volcano during the previous days, but the eruption came apparently as a surprise.No injuries or damage were reported from the eruption. Indonesia's Civil Protection BNPB declared a 4 km exclusion zone in a circle around the crater, extended to 6.5 km in the NW sector. Local communities were warned of potential pyroclastic flows (hot avalanches of blocks, ash and gas) and mud flows that could occur as as result of the eruption, especially in the rivers upstream around the slopes of Mount Soputan, such as Ranowangko River, Lawian River, Popang River and Londola Kelewahu.The volcano's alert level was eraised to the second highest 3 (\"siaga\" - standby) on a scale of 1-4.The volcano lies on the same island as Friday's catastrophic M7.4 earthquake near Palu at about 600 km distance to the ENE. The earthquake had caused a tsunami which had claimed more than 1000 lives. Whether the two events are linked is impossible to say at the moment, but large earthquakes such as this are known to be able to help trigger volcanic eruptions in certain cases (when the volcano is \"ready\" to erupt anyway).\n\nThe small Soputan stratovolcano on the southern rim of the Quaternary Tondano caldera on the northern arm of Sulawesi Island is one of Sulawesi's most active volcanoes. The youthful, largely unvegetated volcano rises to 1784 m and is located SW of Sempu volcano. It was constructed at the southern end of a SSW-NNE trending line of vents.

Our correspondent Doni Janskulo from Kalianda, Lampung, took advantage of very clear views yesterday and managed to take some of the most extraordinary and dramatic footage yet of the explosions on collapsed Anak Krakatau island.Even though it is from 40 km away, it shows the activity in amazing detail. It takes place at the island of Anak Krakatau, hidden from view now behind Panjang island seen in the foreground. The active vent is now under water and lets sea water interact violently with the rising magma: the result is so-called Surtseyan activity, a type of volcanic eruption that takes place in shallow seas or lakes, named after the island of Surtsey which appeared off the southern coast of Iceland and had this activity in 1963.In this video, very powerful explosions can be seen generating jets of ash, debris, steam and water to several hundred meters (\"rooster tails\") radially from the explosion point.In addition, large surges (horizontally expanding hot clouds of steam mixed with ash) can be seen sometimes engulfing the whole island of Panjang, which is hiding the view of Anak Krakatau itself.Be sure to watch to the end, at times, the explosions tend to be bigger and bigger throughout the video.The video was generously granted for display here by local resident and videographer Doni Janskulo, who lost most of his equipment during the 22 Dec 2018 tsunami that devastated Java's west coast.If you want to support him, subscribe to his youtube channel or embed this video."}, {"title": "Krakatau volcano (Indonesia): eruption continues with no signs of weakening", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/krakatau/news/70868/Krakatau-volcano-Indonesia-eruption-continues-with-no-signs-of-weakening.html", "content": "Caldera 813 m (2,667 ft.) / Anak Krakatau: 189 mSunda Strait, Indonesia, -6.1\u00b0S / 105.42\u00b0E(3 out of 5)1530, 1680-81, 1684, 1883 (Plinian eruption), 1927-30, 1931-32, 1932-34, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938-40, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1946-47, 1949, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1958-59, 1959-63, 1965(?), 1969(?), 1972-73, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1988, 1992-93, 1994-95, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2007-8, April 2009-early 2010, Oct 2010 - March 2011, July-Oct 2011, Jan-May + Sep 2012, 2015(?), 2017, 2018 ( 22 Dec eruption & tsunami Explosive.

It is als known as Rejo te Kvachi, \"Kavachi's Oven\", and one of the most active of the Pacific with near surface eruptions every few years that often build temporary islands. New islands were formed at least 9 times since its first recorded eruption during 1939. The new islands formed were not large enough and coated with solid lava flows to be able to resist wave erosion. They were submerged again after a few months after each eruption. The frequent shallow submarine eruptions that sometimes breach the surface produce surtseyan activity, magma-water explosions that eject jets of steam, ash, and incandescent bombs above the sea surface. On some occasions during such eruptions, the vent was sealed sufficiently to produce liquid lava spattering and lava flows on the temporary islands.\n\nKavachi volcano (Solomon Islands) news:\n\nKavachi undersea volcano (Solomon Islands) erupts again\n\nSaturday Feb 01, 2014 09:02 AM | BY: T\n\nThe discolored water plume from Kavachi volcano (NASA Earth Observatory image by Jesse Allen and Robert Simmon, using EO-1 ALI data from the NASA EO-1 team.

The discoloration is likely from suspended volcanic sediments (the fragmented lava) and gasses.Kavachi is an undersea volcano on the southern edge of the Solomon Islands in the western Pacific Ocean. It erupted dozens of times in the 20th century, often breaking the water surface, only to be eroded back below the water line within a few months.Whether the new eruption will break the surface and create another new island remains to be seen. Directly above the undersea peak, a bright patch is visible that suggests vigorously churning water\u2014but there is no sign that the eruption has broken the surface.

But they only got a third of the way.\n\nThe mine owners had never bothered to finish the ladder to the top.\n\nIn their first remote phone contact with government officials above ground 18 days after getting trapped in the San Jose mine in the Atacama Desert, the miners told them that the emergency ladder, which every mine in Chile is supposed to have, did not exist.\n\n\"That evacuation exit was clear for 48 hours after the accident, and the miners could have gotten out if the ladder had been fully in place,\" said an upset Laurence Golborne, the country's mining minister, to the media after speaking with the shift leader Luis Urzua inside the mine.\n\nThe owners of the San Esteban Mining Company that controls the mine said that it was thanks to their safety regulations that the miners were found alive and well. But this outraged the workers' families and worsened their public image. Not even the refuge at the bottom of the mine, where the miners were presumed to be while rescue workers drilled into the solid rock for two weeks in an effort to reach them, was a safe haven.\n\nOn Thursday, a small camera was lowered down the grapefruit-sized duct that has been piping messages, water, food and supplies to the miners. With one miner filming and another illuminating the inside of the mine with the beam of his safety helmet, the miners showed their living conditions and took turns greeting their loved ones.\n\n\"This is the famous refuge,\" said miner Mario Sepulveda in the video, as he pointed to the shabby sign with \"Refuge\" stamped on it. \"It was supposed to be in conditions to shelter us, but when we got here, the energy was cut off and there was no ventilation,\" he said bitterly.\n\nIt was an accident waiting to happen. And after it happened, the medium-sized gold and copper mine, 500 miles north of Santiago, became the epitome of unsafe mining practices. Alejandro Bohn and Marcelo Kemeny, owners of the San Esteban Mining Company, have been demonized by the public as an example of the ultimate disregard for human life.\n\nMiner unions had continuously accused the San Jose mine for its faulty safety measures, but the company attracts workers with higher than average salaries and benefits. In 2004, miner Pedro Gonzalez died after a cave in. In 2006, a truck driver in the mine, Fernando Contreras, was also killed in an accident. That same year 182 workers were injured, 56 of them seriously, according to Vincenot Tobar, a risk management expert who worked for the company until late last year.\n\nBohn and Kemeny were charged with involuntary manslaughter for Contreras' death, but the case was dropped in 2008 after they agreed to pay the family some $170,000 in compensation.\n\nIn January 2007, a geologist assistant, Manuel Villagran, died in the San Jose mine after a rock explosion, and Sernageomin, the government body responsible for supervising mining safety standards, ordered the mine closed.\n\nHowever, less than a year later the San Jose mine was back in operations, even though it had not complied with the basic safety measures ordered by Sernageomin. One of those measures was supposed to be completing the evacuation ladder. Less than two months ago, another miner, Gino Cortes, suffered the amputation of his leg in another avoidable accident.\n\nThe latest dramatic accident in the 120-year-old mine has again turned the spotlight on mining safety and the need for stricter supervision in a country that is reputed to be the world's top copper producer. It is considered the second worst major accident in modern mining history since 1945, when 355 workers suffocated in the El Teniente mine, then owned by the Braden Copper Company.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, is riding high on its success in finding the miners on Aug. 22, all alive and in fairly good condition. From the anonymity of a former CEO, Golborne has leaped to stardom, signing autographs and having his picture taken with cheering supporters on the street.\n\nIn carefully crafted media appearances, President Sebastian Pinera, a former businessman, has emerged as a leader willing to take on corporate irresponsibility, vowing to overhaul labor safety regulations and bring to justice those responsible for the accident, whether they are part of the company or part of the government.\n\n\"This has left Pinera in a stronger political position and the challenge now is to sustain public interest and attention during the time it takes to rescue the miners in order to maintain the political leverage he has now achieved,\" said Robert Funk, academic vice director of the University of Chile's Institute of Public Affairs.\n\nA few days after the accident, Pinera dismissed the national director of Sernageomin, Alejandro Vio, the Atacama regional director of the agency, Rodolfo Diaz, and another top agency official.\n\nMore recently, Pinera announced the creation of a work safety commission in charge of drafting a report over the next three months on safety conditions in mining, agriculture and industry.\n\nThis week, the Minister of Mining announced major surgery to Sernageomin, \"so that accidents like the San Jose mine will never happen again.\" The plan includes creating a Superintendence of Mining, doubling its annual budget and increasing the number of its inspectors from the current 18 to 45.\n\nBut laws and regulations aren't the problem, says mining engineer Agustin Holgado.\n\n\"Chile has one of the strictest mining safety standards in the world, especially in large mining operations, with specific codes and its own regulatory agency,\" he said. \"The problem is enforcement, especially in medium to small-size mines. I have been manager of mines the size of San Jose and I've never seen workers exposed to such extreme risk as in that mine.\"\n\nFive days after the mine collapsed, the congressional mining commission opened an investigation into the causes of the accident, mining safety and enforcement. Former and current Sernageomin officials have been called to testify, as have the owners of the company, who have not shown up so far.\n\nIn Atacama, the regional public prosecutor's office is investigating the company owners for their responsibility in Gino Cortes' accident and the cave in on Aug. 5. Both owners have gone through lengthy interrogations.\n\nThis week, two lawsuits were filed on behalf of the miners' families, both against the company owners and government officials responsible for allowing the mine to operate in unsafe conditions. Another lawsuit was filed against the company for breach of legal duty in order to prevent it from transferring its assets to third parties.\n\nAnother parallel drama is playing out among the more than 100 San Jose miners who have suddenly found themselves without work. The company paid the August salaries to its 140 workers \u2014 including the families of the 33 \u2014 but announced that it didn't have enough funds to cover September and beyond.\n\nBohn, one of the owners, said in a radio interview that they would ask the government for help to cover the payments. His attorney, Hernan Tuane, said that if the company was flooded with lawsuits, they might have to file for bankruptcy.\n\nAnd that was the last straw.\n\n\"What they are saying is incredible,\" said Golborne, the mining minister. \"The main responsibility for all of this is theirs. They can forget that the government will help a company that has behaved in such a manner.\"\n\nIn fact, the government brought the case to the State Defense Council, an autonomous body in charge of protecting state assets, to ensure the San Esteban Mining Company pays back the enormous amount of resources the government has and will spend on rescue efforts.\n\nMeanwhile, Sernageomin, which claims that it doesn't have the resources or personnel to adequately supervise all the mines in Chile, has closed 18 small- and medium-sized mines in the Atacama region since the accident. Most of the infractions are for unsafe working conditions, including lack of ventilation shafts, alternative evacuation exits and emergency shelters.\n\n\"There is a before and an after to the mine cave in.

Seismic and visual eruptive activity sharply decreased since the beginning of December and ceased about 2 weeks ago.During the 4 months of continuous activity, the main phenomena associated with this period were: the emission of lava flows on the ESE flank and ash columns that were directed mainly towards the west. These volcanic phenomena did not affect significantly any populated areas (which are very sparse in the vicinity of the volcano). Only very light ash fall occurred in the city of Guayaquil on 18 Sep and caused no damage.Visual Observations and Surface Activity:The most significant surface activity during this period were ash emissions reaching typically 900 +- 450 m above the crater and only occasionally exceeded 2 km. On most days the ash plumes drifted toward the west and northwest. During this period the Washington VAAC reported 164 ash alertsAdditionally, there was continuous emission of lava flows from a lateral vent on the upper ESE flank of the volcano. The lava flows descended to 1-2 km downhill, generating glowing avalanches and small pyroclastic flows caused by collapsing lava material on the steep flank. The pyroclastic flows reached distances of up to 7 km from the crater."}, {"title": "Villarrica Volcano Volcanic Ash Advisory: NO ERUPTION", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/villarrica/news/73541/Villarrica-Volcano-Volcanic-Ash-Advisory-NO-ERUPTION-.html", "content": "Snow-covered Villarrica, one of Chile's most active volcanoes, rises above the lake and town of the same name.

Here's Why", "url": "http://time.com/5031607/earthquake-predictions-2018/", "content": "There is no natural disaster sneakier than an earthquake. Hurricanes can be predicted and tracked weeks in advance, and even tornados, monsoons and blizzards at least have seasons. But earthquakes strike entirely without warning. Now, however, a new study suggests that we may want to brace for a surge of quakes in the year ahead, and the reason for the danger is an unlikely one: the rotation of the Earth has slowed slightly.\n\nWhile accurately forecasting earthquakes is impossible, a backward look through the seismic record allows geologists to detect some distinct patterns. In the new study \u2014 which was presented at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America, in Seattle, and published in Geophysical Research Letters \u2014 geologists Roger Bilham of the University of Colorado, Boulder, and Rebecca Bendick of the University of Montana, tracked the incidence of magnitude 7 or greater earthquakes worldwide since 1900. While in most years there is an average of just 15 such major shake-ups \u2014 already more than enough \u2014 there have been evenly spaced intervals in the past 117 years in which the annual total jumped to between 25 and 30.\n\nA little more than a century on a planet that is more than 4 billion years old is not exactly a representative time sample, but Bilham and Bendick noticed something else about these volatile, quake-prone periods. They seem to follow periodic slowdowns in speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation. Our solid planet is a lot less solid than it seems, and that\u2019s true not just of its oceans and air, but of its outer core, which is about 1,200 mi. (2,200 km) thick and is composed mostly of liquid iron and nickel. That molten ooze tends to slosh about, following a pattern that oscillates more or less predictably over time, much the way \u2014 on a vastly smaller and more fleeting scale \u2014 water sloshing in a bucket will move back and forth in a repeating cycle.\n\nSuch motion deep inside the Earth slightly changes the planet\u2019s rate of spin, adding to or subtracting from the 24-hour day by about a millisecond \u2014 a change that is regularly recorded by atomic clocks. When a slowdown occurs, the molten core continues to strain outward, obeying Newton\u2019s fundamental law that objects in motion will try as hard as they can to remain in motion.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThat outward pressure slowly propagates through the rocks and plates and faults that lie above it. Bilham and Bendick calculate that it takes five to six years for the energy sent out by the core to radiate to the upper layers of the planet where quakes occur, meaning that after the atomic clock notices a slowdown you\u2019ve got five to six years before you\u2019d better buckle up.\n\nThe last such time the planet slowed was in 2011, and recent events suggest a troubling pattern again playing out: the magnitude 7.1 quake that struck Mexico City on Sept. 19; the 7.3 event on the Iran-Iraq border on Nov. 12; and the 7.0 off New Caledonia on Nov. 19.\n\nNot only does the new study suggest when there could be an uptick in quakes, it also points to where: near the equator, within a latitude of 30\u00ba north or south. It makes sense that this would be the danger zone because any given point along the equator \u2014 the planet\u2019s widest point \u2014 rotates up to 1,000 mph (1,600 k/h) faster than a point closer to the poles, so a slowdown in the overall spin would be more powerful along that midline. The Iran-Iraq quake occurred at about 33\u00ba north latitude, exceeding that cartographic limit, but not by much.\n\nNone of this says that 2018 will definitely be a more geologically unstable year, and it certainly doesn\u2019t pinpoint where any possible quaking will occur. It does say that the maddeningly imprecise science of earthquake prediction has at least gotten a tiny bit more precise. For disasters with such deadly stakes, even that small improvement makes a difference.\n\nWrite to Jeffrey Kluger at jeffrey.kluger@time.com."}]}, {"actual_city": "Ndoi Island, Fiji", "occurence_timestamp": 1548584188720, "occurence_date": "27 Jan 2019", "magnitude": 5.8, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.0 earthquake on Tue, 27 Nov 03:13:56 UTC / - 164km S of Ndoi Island, Fiji -", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2184983/M5-Tue-27-Nov--164km-S-of-Ndoi-Island-Fiji.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

Look at www.telegraph.co.uk tomorrow to follow developments. Thanks for reading.\n\n23:48 Various comparisons are being given to demonstrate the power of the earthquake and tsunami, from the simultaneous detonation of every nuclear warhead on Earth (Daily Mail), to the explosion of 1.5 billion tonnes of TNT (Financial Times), to dropping the Isle of Wight into the Pacific (this newspaper).\n\n23:46 Clear examples are emerging of how well prepared Japan is for earthquakes: cupboards with sensors which automatically lock to prevent their contents causing damage, and a man running a china shop who sells vases for up to \u00a35,000 who hadn't lost a single plate.\n\n23:38 The Independent newspaper is quoting reports of tens of thousands of people missing. That's many times the official police estimates.\n\n23:12 What appeared to be a relatively controllable problem at the Fukushima facility is starting to look more serious. Mark Hibbs, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said if the cooling systems were not repaired within 24 hours, the plant risked a \u201cdefinite danger of a core meltdown\", with the \u201cultimate worst-case\u201d was a \u201cChernobyl scenario\u201d with explosions destroying the reactor.\n\n22:42 Second power plant at Fukushima starting to lose its cooling systems, according to Japanese officials.\n\n22:10 Fukushima plant is still partly submerged in the floodwater.\n\n22:03 Radiation at Fukushima nuclear power station rising to 1,000 times normal levels, according to unconfirmed reports.\n\n21:46\n\nAn oil refinery in Chiba, near Tokyo, burns after the earthquake\n\n21:39 Experts say the No1 Reactor at the nuclear plant is 40 years old.\n\n21:37 Reports suggest possibility of radiation leak at nuclear power station at Fukushima.

Political Parties Integrity Commission.\n\nAccording to a statement from the United Party, the caretaker government has until this Thursday to make the appointments or answerable to a court of law.\n\nThe Party has been pushing to register to contest next year\u2019s National General Elections since the beginning of this year but whilst it complies with the requirements of the PPI Act, the Government has been slow in appointing the Commissioners of the PPI Commission who should approve UP\u2019s membership to be registered as a political party.\n\nIn a letter to the caretaker Prime Minister Rick Houenipwela, UP lawyer Andrew Radcliffe said all remaining steps that needs to be taken to ensure his client and other interested political parties can be registered must be carried out as a matter of urgency.\n\nHe said UP has already taken steps to comply with the registration process but registration cannot take place until members of the Commission have been sworn in and their appointments gazetted.\n\nMr Radcliffe said any steps should also be taken immediately to ensure that the Registrar is available to perform his role under the Act.\n\nHe said UP intends to field candidates at the General Election to be held in early 2019 and the Political Parties Integrity Act 2014 states that a party has to be registered under the Act before it can put up candidates for the election.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Radcliffe said he was instructed that there are a number of obstacles to registration that are outside UP\u2019s control.\n\nHe said one of those obstacles, the mistake in the Electoral Act 2018, has been corrected by Parliament.\n\nMr Radcliffe adds, members of the Commission established by the PPI Act were appointed on 30 November 2018 but have not yet been sworn in saying his client has ascertained that two of the appointees were unaware of their appointments.\n\nHe said as it is the Commission that registers political parties there must be a Commission in place that is capable of performing its statutory role.\n\nRadcliffe further argues that Section 13 of the Constitution says it is a fundamental right that people have the right to form or belong to political parties.\n\nHe said failure by the authorities to fully comply with the PPI Act is an infringement of UP\u2019s constitutional rights as although they are free to form a party, the UP members cannot stand for election as party representatives unless UP is registered as a political party.\n\nRadcliffe said the formation of responsible political parties is in the national interest.\n\nHe further stated that a law has been passed to require registration of political parties and that law is meaningless unless the process to enable registration is complied with."},

forecast for the 2018-2019 season\n\nBy Brian Lada, AccuWeather meteorologist and staff writer November 07, 2018, 8:20:39 AM EST\n\n\n\nDrought concerns will build from Colombia through northern Brazil this summer, while rain and thunderstorms limit the heat from Peru to Uruguay.\n\nAccuWeather meteorologist are also anticipating El Ni\u00f1o conditions to develop, influencing the weather pattern across South America during the summer months.\n\nEl Ni\u00f1o is part of a routine cycle of water temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that can affect the weather around the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\nRain, thunderstorms to bring flood threat from Peru to Uruguay\n\nThe warm waters in the Pacific Ocean associated with El Ni\u00f1o will help to fuel frequent rounds of rain and thunderstorms across a section of South America this summer, stretching from Ecuador and Peru into Uruguay.\n\n\u201cNear to above-normal rainfall across far southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and northern Argentina will result in overall favorable conditions for crops,\u201d AccuWeather Lead Global Meteorologist Jason Nicholls said.\n\nRain will also push farther north on occasion, reaching into far southern Colombia and across central Brazil, but rainfall in this zone will not be as frequent as areas to the south.\n\n\u201cMajor cities such as Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Montevideo, Uruguay, will also have near to above-normal rainfall with temperatures near to slightly above normal,\u201c Nicholls added.\n\nWhile these cities will experience spells of warmer weather, the wet weather pattern will limit the potential for extended heat waves.\n\nHeavy rain may also lead to bouts of flooding across this region, according to Nicholls.\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistent rain or drenching downpours from thunderstorms over the more mountainous terrain, such as in the Andes, could also bring the risk of landslides and debris flows.\n\nLocations along the Huallaga River in Peru will be one of the areas susceptible to flooding this summer following heavy autumn rains.\n\nAs of Oct. 29, the river was more than three meters above its normal level, according to a report from the Government of Peru.\n\nAdditional rounds of heavy rain in the coming months could quickly bring a renewed risk of flooding along the river.\n\nDrought concerns to build over eastern, northern Brazil\n\nWhile a wet summer is forecast for central-west and far southern Brazil, other parts of the country will be facing dry spells and potential drought.\n\n\u201cSome rain is possible from the Brazilian states of Maranhao to Rio Grande Do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Sergipe early in the season, but as high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean flexes west later in the season, rains will become less frequent,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\n\u201cPockets of drought can develop in these areas as the season progresses,\u201d Nicholls added.\n\nThis includes the cities of Rio de Janeiro, Bras\u00edlia and Salvador, Brazil.\n\nRELATED:\n\nSouth America weather center\n\nWhat is El Ni\u00f1o?\n\nInteractive weather satellite\n\n25 ultimate things to do in Chile\n\nA drier-than-normal summer is also on tap across much of northern Brazil and bordering countries.\n\n\u201cRainfall will be lacking from Colombia to French Guiana and north-central Brazil, resulting in developing or worsening drought conditions,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\nThe upcoming dry pattern could cause levels in water reservoirs to drop in countries that rely heavily on hydropower for electricity, such as Colombia and Venezuela.\n\nHeat to focus on central Chile, Argentina following early-season storms\n\nA warm and dry weather pattern will dominate much of Chile and part of Argentina this summer with the hottest conditions holding off until the second half of the season.\n\n\u201cMuch of northern and central Chile into central Argentina will be warmer and drier than normal with occasional rounds of heat across central Chile,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\nIt may take until the start of 2019 before heat waves sizzle the region due to the passage of early-season storms.\n\n\u201cStorms will continue to push across far southern Chile and southern Argentina during December with several rounds of precipitation,\u201d Nicholls said.\n\n\u201cRainfall with any systems that reach into central Chile will be limited across the coastal and valley areas, including Santiago, but there can be early-season rain and snow over the central Andes,\u201c Nicholls added.\n\nThese storms will help to limit the heat across the region in December, but as the season progresses, the storms are expected to track father south, opening the door for longer stretches of hot and dry conditions.\n\n\u201cHeat waves will grip these areas, especially during January and February,\u201c Nicholls said.\n\nThe frequency of storms will also decrease across southern Chile and southern Argentina as the summer transpires, allowing for periods of tranquil, dry weather.\n\n\n\nReport a Typo"}]}, {"actual_city": "Finschhafen, Papua New Guinea", "occurence_timestamp": 1548356195930, "occurence_date": "24 Jan

First, the Ketchikan High Academic Decathlon team won its first state title in March. But that was just the beginning. Representing Alaska in the National Finals in Texas in April, the team won the National Division III title, the first time that any Ketchikan High School group has ever won a national title. The team was coached by Peter Stanton. The team members were: Esme Anderson, Megan Cornwall, Mackenzie Fousel, Charisma Manalo, Adrian Ronquillo, Lydia Sumrall, Max Varela and Largim Zhuta. Then sports teams from Ketchikan High School ended long doubts. The Kayhi boys' soccer team defeated Juneau Douglas for the first time in more than a decade. Even the coaches weren\u2019t sure when Kayhi last beat Juneau, but it was at least 10 years ago. And the Kayhi boys' track field team won its first regional title in 20 years in May. KHS Boys' Baseball Team posed after winning the Regional in Sitka; next on their way to the state tournament where they finished 3rd.\n\nProvided to SitNews by Photographer HEATHER HOLT \u00a92018 The Kayhi girls' softball team finished 2nd in the state tournament and the boys' baseball team finished 3rd. Those were the highest finishes by Kayhi athletic teams at state in the past six years. The Metlakatla boys' b-ball team won the state title and the girls finished second. The Craig volleyball team finished second in the state. Schoenbar eighth grader Grace Parrot became the first Ketchikan student to take part in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington D.C. She was one of 321 spellers who made it to the third round, Parrot finished 42nd overall in the contest. Further on the youth front, the Ketchikan 13-year-old baseball all-stars won the state title and represented Alaska in the western regionals in San Jose, California. And Joshua Cohen not only represented Alaska in the national Special Olympics in Washington, he won a gold medal, besting all comers in bocce ball. Cohen and Jesse Guinn also finished fifth in the unified bocce doubles. Also notable was the Kayhi girls' basketball team winning its fifth consecutive SE title and the boys' wrestling team winning its 11th consecutive SE title. Kayhi\u2019s regional wrestling title winners were Degan Linne, Kai Biagi, Patrick Rauwolf, Matthew Rodriguez, Charlie Blair, Andy Collins, Brayden Linne, Richie Stewart, Carson Cowan, and Brandon Wieber. Louise Bueno was SE champion in the girls division. In non-youth news, the biggest story in 2018 was the chaos caused by a catastrophically low king salmon run in both Southeast and British Columbia. Commercial fishing seasons were slashed early in the summer to protect the few returning kings for escapement and sport fishing limits were slashed in Southeast and completely cut in the Prince Rupert area. The remaining King Salmon Derbies in Southeast were either curtailed or moved to later in the season. For the first time in more than 60 years, the Ketchikan King Salmon Derby became a Silver Salmon Derby and was moved from May and June to August. And 11 people survived when a Taquan Air turbine otter crashed on Jumbo Mountain on Prince of Wales Island in July. 11 people rescued after a Taquan float plane crashed 39 miles south southwest of Ketchikan on Prince of Wales Island, July 10, 2018. The plane crashed on Prince of Wales Island, on the west side of Mount Jumbo. All 11 people were taken to a staging area nearby for further transfer to Ketchikan.\n\n11 rescued from plane crash on POW - SitNews July 10, 2018\n\nU.S. Coast Guard photo - Alaska District 17 JANUARY Lyanna Raine Mckeehan was Ketchikan\u2019s first baby of 2018, born on Jan. 2.

Borough Attorney Scott Brandt-Erichsen retired after serving nearly 23 years in the position. He was replaced by school board member Glenn Brown. Former school board member Dave Timmerman was sentenced to 10 days in jail after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor assault charges that were filed shortly before the October 2017 election.

Jabal said it planned to try to sell the ferry to an operator in Asia, but that fell through and, the 54-year-old vessel, one of the original Alaska Marine Highway vessels, was scrapped. The ferry left Ketchikan in March and ended up at a marine scrap yard in India.

Ketchikan Indian Corporation elected five members to its council out of the 12 people running. Elected were Trixie Bennet, Gloria Burns, Sue Pickrell, Judy Leask Guthrie and Marsha Ramirez. Residents were jarred from a sound sleep when emergency warnings began pinging on cell phones at 12:30 am on January 23. The cause was a region wide tsunami alert caused when a 7.9 magnitude quake struck near Kodiak. The warnings were cancelled three hours later when no tsunami developed. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) held a packed open house to discuss changes to the federal flood plain maps that could dramatically increase insurance costs for some property owners. The changes could mean that the number of properties in the community that fall into flood plains would increase from 48 to more than 1,000. Nearly all of Behm Canal was off limits to king salmon fishing in 2018. The Alaska Board of Fisheries closed the area from Bailey Bay to Point Evans to salmon fishing completely and eliminated king salmon retention between Indian Point and South Revillagigedo Channel. Kings could only be caught between Caamano Point and Indian Point from April to mid August. The reason for the closure was because only 865 Unuk River kings are expected to return, far below the necessary escapement of 1,800 salmon.

Former longtime State Representative Bill Williams was honored in Saxman for his political achievements, including being the former Mayor of Saxman and the President of Cape Fox Corporation. Breaking with more than seven decades of tradition, the annual Ketchikan salmon derby opted for a change in catch and time. With derbies all over the region changing from king salmon derbies to coho derbies because of catastrophically low expected returns. The CHARR Ketchikan derby followed suit and announced a switch to a coho derby \u2013 although organizers said they hoped the change would be temporary.

A new brewery, the first in Ketchikan in more than a decade, opened up on Bawden Street and was called, appropriately enough, the Bawden Street Brewery. Ketchikan was struck by an unusual spate of good weather from mid-July to early August. For more than two weeks there was not only no rain, there were hardly any clouds and daily highs remained in the mid-70s and low 80s. It got so dry that local fire officials warned that the forest and the muskegs were in danger of burning if residents were not careful with their camp fires and burn barrels. Naturally, after a week or so, some residents began complaining that the heat and humidity were oppressive and that their water cisterns were drying up. Fortunately for them, the rains returned, somewhat, early in August. The warm weather was also the cause of an unusual algae bloom that caused much of the Southeast salt water to turn a greenish color more often seen in tropical waters.

Prince Rupert was \u2013 for the first time in its recorded history \u2013 the warmest spot in Canada at 69. Ketchikan set an official record high for a January 14 with 59, although numerous other local thermometers recorded temps well into the 60s. Spring was slow in coming, especially when a snow storm dumped 5-7 inches on Ketchikan on April 3. An extremely short and intense micro-storm hit the first city on April 10. Wind gusts of up to 112 mph were recorded at Salmon Landing. Gusts up to 85 were recorded at the airport. The storm last only a couple of hours, but knocked out power to much of the community. Ketchikan got a brief \u201cheatstorm\u201d the second week in July as temperatures for two days soared to 80 degrees, according to the weather service. Several local thermometers had the temps in the upper 80s. Ketchikan had one of its driest summers and early falls on record, with barely 11 inches of rain being recorded in June, July and August. September and October were also well below normal and more normal rainfall toward the end of the year could not bring the yearly total any where near normal amounts. The low rainfall also hurt salmon escapement in area streams and forced electric utilities to shift from hydro to diesel generation two months earlier than normal. Overall, Ketchikan had 106 inches of rain in 2018, nearly three feet less than normal.

A series of very strong explosions occurred on Tuesday (22 Jan 2019) which destroyed the most recent lava dome that had accumulated in the summit crater.The strongest was a powerful vulcanian-type eruption at 21:07 local time, which ejected incandescent material to more than 2 km height and distance from the crater and produced an ash plume that rose approx. 4 km above the summit. The ejecta showered the entire upper cone of the volcano with glowing bombs, in up to 2 km distance.The shock wave from the explosion rattled doors and windows in the towns and villages at the feet of the volcano.Here's an impressive video of the event:\n\nVolc\u00e1n Popocat\u00e9petl, whose name is the Aztec word for smoking mountain, towers to 5426 m 70 km SE of Mexico City to form North America's 2nd-highest volcano. The glacier-clad stratovolcano contains a steep-walled, 250-450 m deep crater. The generally symmetrical volcano is modified by the sharp-peaked Ventorrillo on the NW, a remnant of an earlier volcano.\n\nAt least three previous major cones were destroyed by gravitational failure during the Pleistocene, producing massive debris-avalanche deposits covering broad areas south of the volcano. The modern volcano was constructed to the south of the late-Pleistocene to Holocene El Fraile cone. Three major plinian eruptions, the most recent of which took place about 800 AD, have occurred from Popocat\u00e9petl since the mid Holocene, accompanied by pyroclastic flows and voluminous lahars that swept basins below the volcano. Frequent historical eruptions, first recorded in Aztec codices, have occurred since precolumbian time.\n\n---\n\nSource: GVP, Smithsonian Institution - Popocatepetl information"}, {"title": "Popocat\u00e9petl Volcano Volcanic Ash Advisory: ERUPTION AT APPROX 23/0305Z RPRTD", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/popocatepetl/news/73970/Popocatepetl-Volcano-Volcanic-Ash-Advisory-ERUPTION-AT-APPROX-230305Z-RPRTD.html", "content": "Popocatepetl is one of Mexico's most active volcanoes.

The tropical disturbance developed into Tropical Cyclone Donna (TC Donna), a Category 1 system, around Wednesday midnight. TC Donna had intensified into a Category 3 system in the evening of 5 May local time. It was located about 175 KM west of Torres and 300 KM west northwest of Gaua (Torba Province) in Northern Vanuatu. The Government of Vanuatu raised the alert levels across the northern provinces...Public alerts were issued over radio and via mass text messages sent out by Telecom Vanuatu and Digicel. (IFRC, 5 May 2017)\n\nAs of 6 May 2017, Torba Province in Northern Vanuatu was the most affected area. According to a quick rapid assessment with Community Disaster Committees on the four islands (Loh, Hui, Tegua and Toga), significant number of houses have been either totally destroyed or damaged. On Loh island, almost all people are sheltered in an evacuation center. (Govt. Vanuatu, 6 May 2017)\n\nOn 8 May, Tropical Cyclone Donna intensified into a Category 5 storm (winds of up to 215 km/h near the centre and gusts of 300 km/h) as it continues to move across Vanuatu towards New Caledonia. Over the weekend, Torba Province, with a population of about 10,000 people, was severely hit...Preliminary reports indicate significant housing damage; however, communication remain disrupted. The National Emergency Operations Centre was activated and is coordinating the in-country response. No fatalities have been confirmed. On 5 May, the Pacific Humanitarian Country Team offered international assistance to the Government and remains on standby to provide support. (OCHA, 8 May 2017)\n\nTropical Cyclone Donna has passed out of the Vanuatu region and the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) gave the all clear on the 9th of May...The Torres Island group in Torba Province remains the most affected area, with other areas in Torba less affected. (Govt. Vanuatu, 10 May 2017)\n\nThe information obtained by the assessment team will be used by the NDMO on Monday (15/05/17) to draft a \u2018phase 2\u2019 relief plan. This plan will be presented to clusters and partner agencies on Tuesday (16/05/17) at the Inter Agency Meeting...Clusters are continuing to make initial remote assessments, preparing response plans and gathering information on available resources for response. This information should also be shared with the NEOC. The NDMO is also considering the need for a long-term recovery plan for community infrastructure (such as schools) damaged during Tropical Cyclone Donna. (Govt. Vanuatu, 12 May 2017)\n\nAs part of the phase 2 activities, the NEOC worked with partners to source the needed supplies which were transported by the Vanuatu Patrol Boat \u2018RVS Tukoro\u2019 which was supported by the Australian Government. The vessel departed Port Vila on 16th May 2017 and will deliver supplies to Hiu, Metoma, Tegua, Loh and Toga Islands. Supplies included personal hygiene kits, tarpaulins, shelter kits, teacher tents, water kits, jerry cans and planting materials. The Provincial Disaster Office vessel from Sola will be taken to Torres to assist with relief operations. Reports were received from Hiu on Sunday 14th May 2017 regarding contaminated water and increased cases on diarrhoea. The NDMO sourced 200 cartons of water which was transported to Hiu by the French Navy Patrol Boat \u2018La Gloriuese.\u2019 The vessel departed Port Vila that afternoon and delivered the water to Hiu on 16th May 2017.

It is the work of the media to bring this two to understand each other.\n\n\u201cWhich means everything we say must be balanced, they must be facts and not opinions or hearsay.\u201d\n\nMr Maka\u2019a said the media industry has done significantly well so far.\n\n\u201cWe are doing a really good job. We must thank our governments for giving us the freedom. That freedom we must not forget, comes with its own responsibilities.\u201d\n\nMr Maka\u2019a worked at the national broadcaster, SIBC since the mid 80s, first in the Programs and Presentation department and then, the News and Current Affairs department.\n\nHe was among founders of the Media Association of Solomon Islands, MASI. He served as President from 1987 to 1989.\n\nMr Maka\u2019a during his time at SIBC attended a number of training overseas that spurned his interest in broadcast media.\n\n\u201cIn 1987 I attended a radio drama training in Netherlands for three months. Being a sound medium, I really enjoyed the radio programs.\n\n\u201cI also attended the European Broadcasting Union, EBU where we had training about sound feature. You say one word, and you hear a sound. It\u2019s a theater of the mind.\n\n\u201cI attended a lot of conferences too. They inspired me a lot in using radio to impart messages.\u201d\n\nMr Maka\u2019a resigned from SIBC in 2005 and moved on to become the National Disaster Management Office\u2019s communication officer.\n\nMr Maka\u2019a\u2019s passion does not revolve solely around broadcasting. He has a passion for creative writing.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by my mother. She would often tell custom stories to the village children, and as I listened I would paint the pictures in my mind.\u201d\n\nMr Maka\u2019a\u2019s first taste of creative writing came just after he left Tenaru School.\n\n\u201cI met late Celestine Kulaghoe, a Marist Brother who taught us creative writing. He told us to write about anything. I wrote my first poem, about basket-ball. He later told me I have a talent to write.\u201d\n\nMr Maka\u2019a\u2019s other initial encounter with creative writing came when he was with Post Telecommunication, his first formal employment.\n\n\u201cOne while I was at Civil Aviation, USP center organised a workshop in creative writing. We were told a professor from Fiji was coming to run the workshop. It lit a fire in me to write creatively.\n\n\u201cI wrote as if there was no tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIn 1985, Mr Maka\u2019a published his first collection of short stories. \u2018The Confession and other stories\u2019 was published by the Institute of Pacific Studies, of the University of the South Pacific.\n\nMr Maka\u2019a has two other stories published online.\n\n\u201cMy passion for creative writing is always with me. I will always write.\u201d\n\nHe has returned to the national broadcaster, overseeing a project that allows him to practice his love of drama, or \u2018 theater of the mind\u2019 as he called it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the stories of the people in the rural areas and the challenges they face daily. The stories should help listeners and the government to understand them.\u201d\n\nThe program comes on every Saturday night at eight and will continue until March 2019.\n\nThis year, Mr Maka\u2019a was one of seven award recipients at the 40th independence anniversary.\n\nLike most people who were present at the recent celebration, Mr Maka\u2019a was touched by the emotional message rendered by Prime Minister Rick Houenipwela on \u2018redirecting Solomon Islands for the next forty years.\u2019\n\nHe said two words stood out for him.\n\n\u201cTalk and action. Talk is cheap, we can talk and talk but if we do nothing, what can we achieve?\n\n\u201cDo more and talk less. That should be our redirection.\u201d\n\nBy: Kikiva Tuni"}, {"title": "Terremoto de magnitude 6,2 sacode as Ilhas Salom\u00e3o", "url": "https://br.sputniknews.com/asia_oceania/2018111612686696-terremoto-ilhas-salomao/", "content": "Estamos comprometidos em proteger suas informa\u00e7\u00f5es pessoais, por isso atualizamos nossa Pol\u00edtica de Privacidade em concord\u00e2ncia com o Regulamento Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados (GPDR), uma nova lei europeia que entrou em vigor no dia 25 de maio de 2018.\n\nPor favor, confira nossa Pol\u00edtica de Privacidade para entender quais dados n\u00f3s coletamos, como os usamos, bem como seus direitos de prote\u00e7\u00e3o de dados.\n\nVisto que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 compartilhou seus dados pessoais conosco para cria\u00e7\u00e3o de conta pessoal, para continuar usando-a, por favor, selecione a op\u00e7\u00e3o abaixo:"}, {"title": "Above normal rainfall predicted for March and May", "url": "http://www.sibconline.com.sb/above-normal-rainfall-predicted-for-march-and-may/", "content": "Above normal rainfall is predicted for most parts of Solomon Islands for the period from March to May 2018 except for Auki in the central region and Munda in the western region which offers no rainfall guidance.\n\nA rainfall outlook issued by the Solomon Islands Meteorological Services says, above normal rainfall is predicted for Henderson and Honiara in the central region, Lata and Kirakira in the eastern region and Taro in the western region.\n\nIt said near average of seven tropical cyclones or chances of 48-percent is predicted to occur in the western South Pacific region this season.\n\nTherefore, one to two cyclones is likely to occur in the Solomon Islands for the season.\n\nMeanwhile, weak La Nina continues to decline in the tropical Pacific however, the condition may still contribute towards the formation of tropical cyclones in the western Pacific region.\n\nCommunities in the islands and the climate sensitive stakeholders are advised to listen to the SIBC for daily weather and marine forecast updates including other extreme weather and climate events that may occur.\n\nBy: Fredrick Kusu."}]}, {"actual_city": "Pamandzi, Mayotte", "occurence_timestamp": 1547356535410, "occurence_date": "13 Jan 2019", "magnitude": 5.1, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Sat, 9 Feb 07:13:41 UTC / MAYOTTE REGION", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2236089/M4-Sat-9-Feb--MAYOTTE-REGION.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

The minister inspected a public kitchen set up to feed the victims, to ensure that it had adequate supplies.\n\n\n\nThe flood-affected regions include Cicalengka, Rancaekek, Cileunyi, Solokan Jeruk, Majalaya, Ciparay, Baleendah, Dayeuhkolot, Bojongsoang, Pameungpeuk, Banjaran, Arjasri, Cangkuang, Katapang and Kutawaringin.\n\n\n\nThe flooding forced more than 8,000 people to evacuate to higher grounds, while submerging over 35,000 homes, and affected some 5,900 families, comprising 24,000 people.\n\n\n\nThe floodwaters reached a height of between 80 cm to three meters, particularly in villages near the river bank.\n\n\n\nThe dead victims included a 13-year-old teenager and a mother aged 40 years old, whose husband and two daughters were reported missing after being swept away by the flash flood.\n\n\n\nThe downpours also triggered a landslide that seriously damaged a house in the Lemburkebon area, Padasuka village, Kutawaringin Sub-district, Bandung.\n\n\n\nFurther, the major floods that ravaged Bandung have caused large losses to industries.\n\n\n\nThe current flooding was the worst to have occurred over the past few years and have caused larger losses than earlier floods, Chairman of the Indonesian Businessman Association (Apindo) of the West Java chapter Deddy Wijaya stated on March 15.\n\n\n\nSeveral factories located in Dayeuhkolot and Banjaran were flooded and remain closed.\n\n\n\nThe flooding also prevented workers from reaching the factories, he noted.\n\n\n\nFloods also submerged machinery and raw materials kept in factories.\n\n\n\n\"In view of the latest condition, material losses could reach billions of rupiah per day,\" he stated.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, flooding caused losses to shop owners and the banking business.\n\n\n\n\"This flooding is the worst over the past 10 years. The floodwaters have reached a height of up to 3.3 meters,\" Coordinator of Bandungs Disaster-Alert Youth said on the phone recently.\n\n\n\nThe office of Dayeuhkolot Sub-district administration, which has not been flooded in 20 years, was inundated to a height of 35 cm this year, he said.\n\n\n\nBNPB Chief Willem Rampangilei supervised the evacuation of the natural disasters victims. They were housed in local government offices, schools and mosques.\n\n\n\nEarlier, on March 2, The BNPB chief told the media that floods and landslides had struck 260 districts and municipalities in the country from January 1 to February 25, leaving 46 people dead and 16 others injured.\n\n\n\nThe natural disasters also forced the evacuation of 1,083.104 people, Willem Rampangilei said at the press conference.\n\n\n\nThe government has made efforts to minimize damage from floods and landslides by holding coordination meetings, familiarizing the public with potential natural disasters, developing contingency plans, strengthening logistics, declaring alert status, and providing relief aid, he said.\n\n\n\n\"When a flood happens, we must first focus on searching and rescuing victims, evacuating refugees and meeting their needs,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTo support emergency rescue operations, meet emergency needs and finance emergency repairs of damaged facilities, the government has set aside Rp3 billion in funds.\n\n\n\n\"The funds have been distributed among the districts of Aceh Utara, Solok Selatan, Solok, 50 Kota, Kampar, Rokan Hulu, Medan, Binjai, Merangin, Bungo, Indramayu, and the province of Bangka Belitung. Each of the regions received Rp250 million,\" Willem said.\n\n\n\nIn addition to Bandung, floods have recently struck three sub-districts in Sukabumi District, as well as in West Java, leaving a number of buildings damaged.\n\n\n\nIn Ketapang District, West Kalimantan Province, three sub-districts -Nanga Tayap, Sandai and Sungai Laur- were also inundated beginning March 10. The flooding is believed to be as bad as in 2010, has affected thousands of local inhabitants.\n\n\n\nFloods also inundated thousands of houses in ten villages in Tangerang District of Banten Province on March 13.\n\n\n\nThe high intensity rain caused the local Cimanceuri River to overflow its banks and sent floods throughout the region, Head of Regional Disaster Mitigation Agency of Tangerang Teteng Jumara said.\n\n\n\nIn Sampang, Madura Island, East Java Province, floods submerged 12 villages, as the Kalikemuning River spilled over its bank last week.\n\n\n\n\"The present flooding is the worst,\" Head of the Sampang Disaster Mitigation Agency Wisno Hatono said recently.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, harvest failures were feared over 1,083 hectares of rice fields in Sampang.\n\n\n\nFloods inundated 7,199 hectares of paddy fields in Riau and over 1,000 hectares in Jambi on Sumatra Island.\n\n\n\nIn the capital city, despite the Jakarta administration\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds efforts to normalize sewage systems, floods reaching a height of up to 120 cm and inundated 20 neighborhoods in early February this year.\n\n\n\nFollowing a recent finding of a large amount of cable jackets in waterways on Merdeka Selatan Road, Central Jakarta, Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) voiced his suspicion about sabotage.\n\n\n\nAhok suggested recently that it demonstrated an attempt by unknown persons to engineer floods and he reported the case to police, the Jakarta Post reported.\n\n\n\nJakarta Police Chief Insp. Gen. Tito Karnavian said the police had yet to conclude that the cable jackets were a form of sabotage.\n\n\n\nOn March 11, Tito announced that six scavengers were detained for allegedly stealing copper and tin inside the cables, believed to have belonged to the State Electricity Company (PLN) , and they left the cable jackets inside the sewers, Tempo.co reported.(*)"}]}, {"actual_city": "Tonga", "occurence_timestamp": 1547273022970, "occurence_date": "12 Jan 2019", "magnitude": 5.2, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M4.7 earthquake on Mon, 3 Dec 23:52:12 UTC / TONGA REGION", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2190784/M4-Mon-3-Dec--TONGA-REGION.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.

The buoys, which communicate with seafloor sensors, are supposed to send tsunami warnings to the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics, but are now ineffective due to vandalism and a lack of funding, according to the report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning,\u201d Louise Comfort, a disaster management expert, told the Associated Press. \u201cNone of the 22 buoys are functioning. In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide.\u201d\n\nBMKG reportedly sent out a tsunami warning on Friday evening after the earthquake, but lifted it 34 minutes later.\n\nEfforts to create better advance tsunami warning systems started after 230,00 people died in a 2004 tsunami, with a majority of those deaths occurring in Indonesia. The buoys were among those efforts\u2014Germany and the U.S. reportedly provided 12 of them. However, an earthquake that hit an Indonesian island in 2016 revealed that none of the buoys were working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe buoys have been stalled in a prototype phase for years, reportedly failing to receive the funding needed because of budget cuts and a failure for agencies to agree on project decisions. The buoys reportedly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each on top of the funding needed to maintain their operations.\n\n\u201cNow we have no buoys in Indonesia,\u201d Iyan Turyana, an ocean engineer at BPPT, Indonesia\u2019s Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology, told Phys.org in an article published in January 2017. \u201cThey are all damaged.

It was as if the area had been carpet-bombed: 221,000 people died in the province already ravaged by war.\n\nA decade later, I visited the Tsunami Museum, the entrance to which is designed around a high wall of dark stone -- symbolizing the wall of water that for many victims was the last thing they saw.\n\nThe striking thing for me was how much care and attention was paid to the memory of this tragedy in a country where so often, the tragic past is carelessly discarded. The museum is also testament to the massive $7 billion effort mounted by the government and international donors to rebuild and rehabilitate Aceh.\n\nPerched along the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia bears the brunt of frequent seismic disasters. The toll in 2018 was particularly heavy at 4,000 fatalities or more from successive earthquakes in Lombok, a tsunami in Palu in central Sulawesi, followed by another in the west coast of Java.\n\nYou would think these tragedies would spur the government to do more to protect its citizens, especially since a tsunami warning system installed over a decade ago had failed. All the more so since 2019 is an election year.\n\nYet there is no sign of such action in election campaigns underway. Neither incumbent President Joko Widodo nor his challenger Prabowo Subianto have promised better protection from natural disasters.\n\nThis is even more surprising because Jokowi, as the president is fondly known, has built his presidency on infrastructure development. He seems more preoccupied with the completion of a highway across Java and a metro system under Jakarta than fixing the network of buoys and tidal gauges that were installed after the 2004 disaster.\n\nThe national disaster agency responsible for installing and maintaining the system is woefully underfunded and poorly led, critics say. Of the 1,000 warning sirens needed, less than 60 are in place. One estimate for replacing the entire warning system comes close to the agency's entire budget of $500 million.\n\nIt's not simply a matter of economic growth or revenue. Rather, it's the lack of concern for grassroots needs that highlights the shortcomings of representative democracy in Indonesia. Free and fair elections are regularly held and peaceful transfer of leadership is now routine, yet none of the contesting political parties nor their candidates do more than pay lip service to the real needs of ordinary Indonesians.\n\nApart from bearing the lethal costs of inadequate disaster protection, Indonesians pay more for rice, fresh beef and other staples than others in Southeast Asia. The World Bank says children in many urban areas in the country are malnourished. Basic healthcare and education remain poorly funded.\n\nNone of these basic needs are central to politicians' campaigns. Instead, they are fixated on religion. While Jokowi's campaign mentions priorities such as human development and equality, a close read finds an emphasis on religious education as a provider of \"national character,\" the promotion of religious entrepreneurs and the ease of the Islamic \"Zakat\" tax to address inequality.\n\nOne explanation is that Indonesian politics is personality-driven; political parties don't generally have sweeping programs aimed at improving society and the lives of ordinary people. Instead, they provide vehicles for competing members of the elite. In a Muslim majority country, one of the surest ways to draw support -- as well as undermine your opponent -- is to play on religious matters.\n\nTo fend off attacks from increasingly vociferous Islamic conservatives, Jokowi enlisted as his running mate an aging Muslim cleric Ma'ruf Amin. As a result, much of the campaign discourse has ranged over topics such as the need for leaders to have good knowledge of the Quran.\n\nThe failure to consider citizens' needs, particularly those who have suffered or feel deprived, is dangerous as it can help breed extremism. Conservative Islamic movements are building a strong support base on the back of social and economic discontent.\n\nAs the people of Palu try to rebuild their lives, an Indonesian analyst suggested that a group known as East Indonesia Mujahiddin had expanded its membership in the area.\n\nMany like myself who witnessed the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami were hoping for the same rapid response in Palu, the welcoming of international aid and assistance, and subsequent rehabilitation efforts. Sadly, Indonesia was a different country in 2004 - a president freshly installed by the first direct election, eager to demonstrate Indonesia's openness and engagement with the world.\n\nToday, much of this openness has been supplanted by narrow-minded petty nationalism and conservatism. The world rushed to offer aid and assistance in Palu. The government hesitated and then rejected most of them. The president did find time -- even as the recovery effort was struggling and he rebuffed help from other sources, including from a nearby British naval vessel -- to thank the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its generous aid, a nod to the conservative Islamic lobby he needs to keep onside to secure his re-election.\n\nMichael Vatikiotis is Asia director of the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue and a former editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review.

I felt the smell of gas,\u201d recalls Jamaliah, now 42, who like many people from her country has just one name. \u201cPeople started shouting: 'Run! The water is coming! The water is rising!\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the help of her husband, Septi Rangkuti, she piled her three children on to a motorbike and its sidecar and sped away. But there was no time: a lava-like surge of water and debris slammed into the family\u2019s vehicle and dragged them into its swell.\n\nZahri, the couple\u2019s eldest son, made it out of the water unscathed but the parents were separated from their other two children, a four-year-old girl called Raudhatul, and Arif, a seven-year-old boy. When the waters receded they were dragged out to sea clinging to a wooden door. \u201cThe current was so strong. The water was like a whirlpool. We never saw them again,\u201d Jamaliah says.\n\nTears form in the eyes of Septi Rangkuti as he recalls watching the pair disappear.\n\n\u201cI felt so sad,\u201d the 52-year-old says. \u201cOur family had been so united \u2013 and in just one day it was destroyed. Suddenly we were pulled apart.\u201d\n\n(AP Photo/Binsar Bakkara)\n\nUnforgettable though it was, the Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed some 275,000 people including 170,000 Indonesians, was just the first chapter in a decade-long saga that has stretched the imagination to its very limits and thrust Jamaliah\u2019s family into the global spotlight.\n\nFor just a few months ago, as the 10th anniversary of the disaster approached, the couple were catapulted to fame following sensational reports that their two missing children, long presumed dead, had been found alive.\n\nRaudhatul and Arif had escaped the tsunami\u2019s destruction, it was claimed, having been swept south towards a tropical island and then plucked from the water by a fisherman who took them in.\n\n\u201cGod gave us a miracle,\u201d Jamaliah told reporters after being reunited with the two children she claimed as hers.\n\n[http://www.theacehglobe.com/2014/09/miracles-of-aceh-tsunami-family.html] In mid-November, those children were brought to Paringgonan Julu, the isolated jungle village to which Jamaliah and her husband moved after the Boxing Day catastrophe. Within three days, they had been enrolled in the local school.\n\n\u201cI always believed she was still alive,\u201d Jamaliah says of her daughter, who is now 14. She tapped her breast with her left hand. \u201cIt was a feeling. It was a belief.\u201d\n\nThe horrifying details of Boxing Day 2004 \u2013 the beginning of the family\u2019s incredible tale \u2013 remain fresh in Jamaliah\u2019s mind to this day.\n\nMeulaboh, on the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra, was the closest habitation to the earthquake\u2019s epicentre and when a wall of water surged over a mile inland the fishing town was pulverised.\n\n\u201cEverything was flattened. Everything was destroyed,\u201d Jamaliah says. \u201cCars had been dragged into the sea, passenger boats brought on to land. Everything was the wrong way around.\u201d\n\nZahri, her eldest son, watched in horror as the scale of the tragedy became clear. \u201cWhen the water went back out I saw so many bodies just lying there. It was scary,\u201d the 18-year-old says. Ten per cent of the city\u2019s 70,000 residents had died.\n\nArif Pratama (left) and Raudhatul Jannah (AP Photo/Binsar Bakkara)\n\nThe extraordinary events of December 26 were soon replaced by a macabre routine. For six weeks, Jamaliah and her husband made daily pilgrimages to the city\u2019s hospital, where the bloated and disfigured corpses of men, women and children lay on the floor of an improvised mortuary.\n\n\u201cWe opened the body bags one by one,\u201d she recalls, tears streaming down her cheeks. \u201cI thought: I believe God will help me.\u201d Yet there was no sign of either child. They abandoned their hospital visits and, in February 2005, returned to the rural village where Septi Rangkuti had been raised.\n\n\u201cThere was no aid, no help from the government. It was better to leave,\u201d Jamaliah says.\n\nIn Paringgonan Julu, a 2,000-strong community of rubber tappers hidden in the forests of North Sumatra, the family attempted to start afresh.\n\nThey built a home, with donations from sympathetic locals, and began rebuilding their careers as a seamstress and an electrician. Jamaliah became pregnant with their fourth child, a boy called Jumadil who was born in July 2007.\n\nThen, in June this year, came a phone call that turned the family\u2019s world upside down once again.\n\nIt was Jamaliah\u2019s brother, who claimed he had spotted their daughter Raudhatul in a coffee shop in the town of Blangpidie, 80 miles southeast of Meulaboh.\n\nWithin days the couple had caught a bus heading north in the hope of meeting their long-lost daughter.\n\n\u201cAfter 10 years without seeing her, it all felt like a dream,\u201d Jamaliah says.\n\n\u201cI grew more and more impatient on the bus. It was taking so long to get there. I just sat there and prayed that it was really her.\u201d When she finally came face to face with the girl she believed was her daughter, Jamaliah was speechless. \u201cWhat could I say? I just cried and embraced her.\u201d\n\nThat reunion would in itself have provided a remarkable denouement to the family\u2019s story \u2013 but there was yet another twist in the plot.\n\nFor while Raudhatul was initially shy and spoke little, she did impart one key piece of information, Jamaliah claims. Arif, her brother, had also survived the tsunami, the girl said. Raudhatul remembered coming ashore with him in the Banyaks, an archipelago of largely uninhabited islands nearly 160 miles south of their home. They had subsequently been separated \u2013 in late 2005 or early 2006 \u2013 but she was certain he had made it out of the water. There was hope.\n\nRe-energised in her quest to reunite her family, Jamaliah launched an appeal for information about her son through the Indonesian media.\n\nIt paid off. Within weeks a call came in from the owner of an internet caf\u00e9 in the city of Payakumbuh. A young boy, resembling Arif but known locally as Ucok, had been sleeping outside her shop, the woman said. When she showed him a photograph of Jamaliah, the boy replied: \u201cThat\u2019s my mother.\u201d Within days Jamaliah claimed him as her missing son.\n\nThe \u201cmiraculous\u201d reunions have been celebrated around the world as a fairy-tale ending to one of the most horrific natural disasters in living memory.\n\nYet they have also raised suspicions, prompting recent claims that Raudhatul \u2013 who in person bears a startling resemblance to Jamaliah \u2013 may not be her daughter at all.\n\n\u201cI have no idea why people are saying she is a tsunami victim,\u201d a woman who claims to have looked after the girl for several years was quoted as saying by Australian media earlier this month.\n\n[ http://www.news.com.au/world/claims-miracle-reunion-of-north-sumatra-family-torn-apart-by-the-boxing-day-tsunami-is-a-lie/story-fndir2ev-1227155011324 ]\n\nJamaliah dismisses such scepticism, suggesting doubts had only been raised after the family with whom Raudhatul had been living demanded financial compensation for having cared for the girl.\n\nThere is no need for a DNA test to prove Raudhatul and Arif are her biological children, she says. \u201cI am 100 per cent sure.\u201d With the family now living hundreds of miles from any major cities \u2013 it is a gruelling, 15-hour drive from Medan, the chaotic provincial capital, to Paringgonan Julu \u2013 and authorities apparently reluctant to intervene, that may be the end of the matter.\n\nHarder to ignore will be the psychological, and in Arif\u2019s case physical, scars carried by two children who have been suddenly uprooted and transplanted into utterly new surroundings.\n\nIll at ease around strangers, Raudhatul, who is now 14, sat nervously picking at a blue and yellow carpet one afternoon last week. The girl said she dreamed of becoming a teacher and that her favourite subject was Indonesian. Otherwise she hardly spoke.\n\nFor Arif, who hopes to join the army, adapting is also likely to be difficult. After being separated from his sister, he claims to have been exploited by a group of human traffickers who forced him to beg as part of a gang of street kids. His erratic behaviour \u2013 at times affectionate and clingy, at times withdrawn \u2013 hints at years spent sleeping rough and what the boy vaguely describes as periods of physical abuse.\n\nThick scars run across his left forearm \u2013 the result, Jamaliah says, of knife fights. A severe burn, apparently from boiling water, stretches over his forehead.\n\n\u201cHe is very quiet. He doesn\u2019t like to talk too much,\u201d Jamaliah admits. \u201cBut he talks to me.\u201d Asked if he was happy in his new surroundings, Arif smiles and nods but says little else.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given how young they were at the time, neither child can offer a detailed account of how they survived the tsunami or their lives since. \u201cWhen we got to the island all I could say was: 'Help me. Help me. Help me,\u2019\u201d is all Arif can remember of his rescue.\n\nSepti Rangkuti, the husband, says he is not worried about the children settling in. Their biggest problem has been grasping Bataknese, the dialect spoken in a region to which they are aliens.\n\nWhatever the truth about the children\u2019s parentage, the six members of Jamaliah\u2019s household will mark the tsunami\u2019s 10-year anniversary with celebration and thanks.\n\nOn December 26, they will turn towards Mecca and prostrate themselves on green and blue prayer mats inside their simple wooden home.\n\nJamaliah\u2019s thoughts will turn to her brother and sister, Nursihah and Maulana, who also vanished when the tsunami reduced Meulaboh to rubble.\n\n\u201cThey were never found,\u201d she said, wiping tears from her eyes with a pink headscarf. \u201cSo many people were lost.\u201d"}, {"title": "", "url": "https://www.nst.com.my/news/2015/09/tsunami-ravaged-aceh-rises-rapidly-ruins", "content": ""}, {"title": "Growing Thunder Risk by Tonight & Sunday - Odds of El Nino Slip To 65%", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/growing-thunder-risk-by-tonight-sunday-odds-of-el-nino-slip-to-65/270539261/", "content": "H2-Oh!\n\nLike many Minnesotans who cherish their 11,842 lakes I need to be near the water.

My main focus is teaching compassion and kindness, that's my own personal philosophy.\n\nKYMBERLEE FERNANDES/STUFF The former Manurewa High student is hoping to back to school to talk to the students about making society a better place for everyone.\n\n\"What's the world without kindness, compassion and confidence?\"\n\nShe is an early childhood teacher at The Treasure Cove Early Learning Centre in Manurewa.\n\nPart of getting into the beauty contest was also to show her children that they can be confident and \"do things that might be a little bit scary and outside of the box\".\n\nThe former Manurewa High student says she is hoping to back to school to talk to the students about making society a better place for everyone, and that working hard pays off.\n\nShe says not many people will stop and chat at the grocery store nowadays. And she would like to see the community engage more.\n\nSimple things like \"smiling at people, saying hello, picking up rubbish, will really enhance society\".\n\nColebrook wants to bring back the trust and respect in the community that she grew up in.\n\n\"What I envision for south Auckland is for us to be more respectful of ourselves, each other and the environment.\"\n\nA few daily goals that she's set for herself for 2018 include:\n\n1. Giving myself a compliment every day. Unfortunately, as women we do put ourselves down, we are our biggest critics.\n\n2. Greeting everyone in the household with a smile every morning.\n\n3. Giving a random person a compliment.\n\n4. Accepting compliments and just saying thank you.\n\n5. Taking the time to be grateful."}]}, {"actual_city": "Nishinoomote, Japan", "occurence_timestamp": 1546951170950, "occurence_date": "08 Jan 2019", "magnitude": 6.3, "news": [{"title": "Magnitude 6.3 quake strikes near Nishinoomote, Japan", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-me-earthquakesa-earthquake-63-quake-strikes-near-nishinoomote-japan-vbrw-story.html", "content": "The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake struck in the evening and had a preliminary magnitude of 6.3.

The move comes within a day of Tara Sweeney's confirmation as Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs.\n\n\"... I am withdrawing Solicitor's Opinion M-37043 so that we may conduct the regulatory review process mandated by the President's Chief of Staff and prepare for consultation with the Indian and Alaska Native communities on an interim policy for off-reservation land-into-trust acquisitions within and outside of Alaska,\" wrote Solicitor Daniel H. Jorjani in a memorandum to both Sweeney and the Bureau of Indian Affairs director on June 29.\n\nThe decision puts a hold on what had been considered a significant piece of land rights ruling stemming from more than three decades of debate.\n\nIn 1978, Associate Solicitor for Indian Affairs Thomas Fredericks issued a memorandum on trust land for the communities of Arctic Village and Venetie. In it, he wrote that it would be an \"abuse of the Secretary's discretion\" to take land into trust on behalf of Alaska Native tribes. He based his belief on writing within the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), which set Alaska apart from other states in terms of the rights and responsibilities of its tribes.\n\nIn his current notice, Solicitor Jorjani quotes ANCSA writing, \"[T]he settlement should be accomplished rapidly ... without creating a reservation system of lengthy wardship or trusteeship, and without adding to the categories of property and institutions enjoying special tax privileges.\"\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, the Alaska exception on land-into-trust came back into the spotlight. The Interior Department questioned whether or not it should change its regulations on the matter in 1999. Two years later, it issued final regulations upholding its earlier decision to not allow land to be taken into trust in Alaska.\n\nDuring a three-year consideration period, the department prevented any land-into-trust action in the state, except in the case of Metlakatla (in Southeast Alaska), which is the state's only reservation.\n\nHowever, the solicitor at the time also rescinded Fredericks' 1978 opinion to allow for more discussions in the future.\n\nFour years after that, in 2006, the Akiachak Native Community, Chilkoot Indian Association, Tuluksak Native Community, Chalkyitsik Village, and Alice Kavairlook brought a lawsuit against the Interior Department, arguing for their right to have land taken into trust.\n\nThe lawsuit put the state of Alaska and the plaintiffs on opposing sides of the argument, with the plaintiffs saying the Alaska exemption was unfair in that all Indian tribes should be treated equally across the country. The state argued that ANCSA mandates special treatment for Alaska tribes and should take priority.\n\nIn 2014, the Interior Department moved to nullify the trust exclusion for Alaska tribes. The state attempted to block the move and while the case moved through the court system, the exemption stood as it had before.\n\nIn 2016, the court decided in favor of the plaintiffs, which set in motion the opportunity for Alaska tribes to petition the federal government to take lands into trust.\n\nWhen land is placed into trust, the federal government holds the legal title for the land. Benefits can include protection for the land, and exemption from imminent domain and state and local taxation, according to a fact sheet from the Tanana Chiefs Conference. Another benefit is trust land, or Indian Country, may include tribal oversight in criminal matters. A potential drawback for certain tribes is that trust land cannot be sold or developed without BIA approval.\n\nJust days before Obama left the White House and Donald Trump took over the presidency, the Interior Solicitor issued an opinion supporting that decision to allow lands to be taken into trust in Alaska.\n\n\"On Jan. 13, 2017, the Solicitor issued M-37043, an analysis of the effects of ANCSA, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA), and the Supreme Court decision in Carcieri v. Salazar on the Secretary of the Interior's authority to accept land into trust in Alaska under the Indian Reorganization Act,\" the current memorandum reads. \"The Solicitor concluded that neither the plain language of these statutes nor the Court's decision in Carcieri repealed or precluded the Secretary's ability to acquire land in trust for Alaska Natives.\"\n\nJust one week later, the day Trump was sworn in, the Chief of Staff \"announced a regulatory review process for any new or pending regulation.\"\n\nJorjani's withdrawal of the Obama-era Solicitor's opinion falls in line with this review process, possibly further holding up the ability for tribes to ask for lands to be taken into trust.\n\nJorjani wrote that he believes a six-month notice and comment period would be appropriate followed by another six months for department review of the decision."}, {"title": "Alaska Region", "url": "https://www.usgs.gov/science/regions/alaska-region", "content": ""}, {"title": "Direct genetic evidence of founding population reveals story of first Native Americans", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2018-01-reveals-evidence-population-ancient-native.html", "content": "Excavations at the Upward Sun River archaeological site in Alaska. The new study shows that the remains found there belonged to members of a previously unknown Native American population, whom academics have named \"Ancient Beringians\". Credit: Ben Potter\n\nDirect genetic traces of the earliest Native Americans have been identified for the first time in a new study. The genetic evidence suggests that people may have entered the continent in a single migratory wave, perhaps arriving more than 20,000 years ago.\n\nThe data, which came from archaeological finds in Alaska, also points to the existence of a previously unknown Native American population, whom academics have named \"Ancient Beringians\".\n\nThe findings are being published in the journal Nature and present possible answers to a series of long-standing questions about how the Americas were first populated.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the earliest settlers crossed from what is now Russia into Alaska via an ancient land bridge spanning the Bering Strait which was submerged at the end of the last Ice Age. Issues such as whether there was one founding group or several, when they arrived, and what happened next, are the subject of extensive debate, however.\n\nIn the new study, an international team of researchers led by academics from the Universities of Cambridge and Copenhagen sequenced the full genome of an infant - a girl named Xach'itee'aanenh t'eede gay, or Sunrise Child-girl, by the local Native community - whose remains were found at the Upward Sun River archaeological site in Alaska in 2013.\n\nTo their surprise, they found that although the child had lived around 11,500 years ago, long after people first arrived in the region, her genetic information did not match either of the two recognised branches of early Native Americans, which are referred to as Northern and Southern. Instead, she appeared to have belonged to an entirely distinct Native American population, which they called Ancient Beringians.\n\nFurther analyses then revealed that the Ancient Beringians were an offshoot of the same ancestor population as the Northern and Southern Native American groups, but that they separated from that population earlier in its history. This timeline allowed the researchers to construct a picture of how and when the continent might have been settled by a common, founding population of ancestral Native Americans, that gradually divided into these different sub-groupings.\n\nThe study was led by Professor Eske Willerslev, who holds positions both at St John's College, University of Cambridge, UK, and the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.\n\n\"The Ancient Beringians diversified from other Native Americans before any ancient or living Native American population sequenced to date. It's basically a relict population of an ancestral group which was common to all Native Americans, so the sequenced genetic data gave us enormous potential in terms of answering questions relating to the early peopling of the Americas,\" he said.\n\n\"We were able to show that people probably entered Alaska before 20,000 years ago. It's the first time that we have had direct genomic evidence that all Native Americans can be traced back to one source population, via a single, founding migration event.\"\n\nThe study compared data from the Upward Sun River remains with both ancient genomes, and those of numerous present-day populations. This allowed the researchers first to establish that the Ancient Beringian group was more closely related to early Native Americans than their Asian and Eurasian ancestors, and then to determine the precise nature of that relationship and how, over time, they split into distinct populations.\n\nUntil now, the existence of two separate Northern and Southern branches of early Native Americans has divided academic opinion regarding how the continent was populated. Researchers have disagreed over whether these two branches split after humans entered Alaska, or whether they represent separate migrations.\n\nThe Upward Sun River genome shows that Ancient Beringians were isolated from the common, ancestral Native American population, both before the Northern and Southern divide, and after the ancestral source population was itself isolated from other groups in Asia. The researchers say that this means it is likely there was one wave of migration into the Americas, with all subdivisions taking place thereafter.\n\nA scientific illustration of the Upward Sun River camp in what is nowInterior Alaska. Credit: Eric S. Carlson in collaboration with Ben A. Potter\n\nAccording to the researchers' timeline, the ancestral population first emerged as a separate group around 36,000 years ago, probably somewhere in northeast Asia. Constant contact with Asian populations continued until around 25,000 years ago, when the gene flow between the two groups ceased. This cessation was probably caused by brutal changes in the climate, which isolated the Native American ancestors. \"It therefore probably indicates the point when people first started moving into Alaska,\" Willerslev said.\n\nAround the same time, there was a level of genetic exchange with an ancient North Eurasian population. Previous research by Willerslev has shown that a relatively specific, localised level of contact between this group, and East Asians, led to the emergence of a distinctive ancestral Native American population.\n\nAncient Beringians themselves then separated from the ancestral group earlier than either the Northern or Southern branches around 20,000 years ago. Genetic contact continued with their Native American cousins, however, at least until the Upward Sun River girl was born in Alaska around 8,500 years later.\n\nThe geographical proximity required for ongoing contact of this sort led the researchers to conclude that the initial migration into the Americas had probably already taken place when the Ancient Beringians broke away from the main ancestral line. Jos Vctor Moreno-Mayar, from the University of Copenhagen, said: \"It looks as though this Ancient Beringian population was up there, in Alaska, from 20,000 years ago until 11,500 years ago, but they were already distinct from the wider Native American group.\"\n\nFinally, the researchers established that the Northern and Southern Native American branches only split between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago which, based on the wider evidence, indicates that they must have already been on the American continent south of the glacial ice.\n\nThe divide probably occurred after their ancestors had passed through, or around, the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets - two vast glaciers which covered what is now Canada and parts of the northern United States, but began to thaw at around this time.\n\nThe continued existence of this ice sheet across much of the north of the continent would have isolated the southbound travellers from the Ancient Beringians in Alaska, who were eventually replaced or absorbed by other Native American populations. Although modern populations in both Alaska and northern Canada belong to the Northern Native American branch, the analysis shows that these derive from a later \"back\" migration north, long after the initial migration events.\n\n\"One significant aspect of this research is that some people have claimed the presence of humans in the Americas dates back earlier - to 30,000 years, 40,000 years, or even more,\" Willerslev added. \"We cannot prove that those claims are not true, but what we are saying, is that if they are correct, they could not possibly have been the direct ancestors to contemporary Native Americans.\"\n\nThe study, Terminal Pleistocene Alaskan genome reveals first founding population of Native Americans, is published in Nature.\n\nExplore further Ancient babies boost Bering land bridge layover: DNA links many Native Americans to infants in Alaskan grave\n\nMore information: J.

Yet perhaps nowhere is the puzzle more difficult than in the Americas, two landmasses divided from the rest of the world by two huge oceans. Zoom out, though, and you\u2019ll see that isolation has only been imposed for the last 11,000 years; before then, a narrow land bridge called Beringia stretched between Siberia and Alaska, providing an icy highway for travelers.\n\nRelated Content Humans May Have Arrived in North America 10,000 Years Earlier Than We Thought\n\nThis week, scientists reported explosive new findings on the genetic story of one of those ancient travelers: an infant girl named Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay by the local indigenous people, who lived for a brief time 11,500 years ago in an Alaskan community now called Upward Sun River. The infant\u2019s genome has the power to rewrite what we know about the human journey into North America\u2014and in doing so, points to the larger genetic revolution that is reshaping the field of archaeology.\n\nFor decades, archaeologists have hypothesized that humans entered the Americas from Asia using Beringia (the first man to suggest the existence of a land bridge was actually a 16th-century Spanish missionary named Fray Jose de Acosta). But even as more sites of occupation were discovered in Siberia and Alaska, pointing to human occupation and the movement from west to east, questions remained. When exactly did the migration happen, and how did it happen? In one wave, or many?\n\nIn January 2017, researchers at the Canadian Museum of History concluded that a horse jawbone found in the Bluefish Caves of the Yukon bore human markings from 24,000 years ago, meaning that early Americans had settled here by 22,000 BC. That would push back the date of human occupation in North America by 10,000 years. But those findings\u2014like so many in this field\u2014proved controversial, and haven\u2019t been universally accepted by the archaeology community.\n\nThe new report on Xach\u2019itee\u2019aanenh T\u2019eede Gaay complicates this narrative further. While she may be \u201cjust\u201d 11,500 years old, she provides incontrovertible evidence for the timing of human migration.\n\nWithin her genome is the story of a newly discovered population of early Americans whose ultimate fate remains a mystery, as their genes are no longer visible in modern populations. \u201cThis individual represents a previously unknown population, which is also the earliest known population of Native Americans,\u201d says Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary geneticist and one of the authors of the new study. \u201cWe can address fundamental questions such as when people came into North America because this population is related to everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe Upward Sun River girl, buried next to an even younger infant in a ceremonial grave with red ochre on both of them, is a member of what researchers are calling the Ancient Beringians. Prior to sequencing her genome, scientists had identified two main groups of Native Americans: Northern Native Americans and Southern Native Americans, who split off sometime after entering the continent. This infant child belongs to neither of those two groups. That means that, somewhere along the way, another split must have occurred to create this unique Ancient Beringian group.\n\nUsing demographic modeling, the researchers concluded that the founding population of Native Americans began splitting from their ancestors in East Asia around 36,000 years ago. By 25,000 years ago, they had made a complete split. By 20,000 years ago, another divergence had happened, this time between the Ancient Beringians and the rest of the Native Americans. And within the next 3,000 to 6,000 years, the Native Americans further divided into Northern and Southern groups.\n\nAll this, from the ancient DNA of one long-dead child.\n\n\u201cNow we have these bounds on the formation of Native Americans,\u201d says Victor Moreno Mayar, another author of the paper and geneticist at the Center for GeoGenetics. \u201cWe think the explanation for this pattern, the one that requires the least movement, was that Native Americans were somewhere in Beringia 20,000 years ago. The best supported archaeological site in Alaska is only 15,000 years old, so we\u2019re pushing the dates back, and it will be controversial because of this.\u201d\n\nThe authors were well aware of the possibility for controversy going into the study. To that end, they included two different models to explain how the Ancient Beringians came to be. In one version, the Beringians split from the rest of the Native Americans before crossing the land bridge into North America, meaning multiple waves of migration. In the second, the group traveled across Beringia as one group, only splitting afterwards. Archaeologist Ben Potter, one of the authors, favors the former.\n\n\u201cI tend to support that on the archaeological side because that fits with the vast majority of archaeological evidence we have,\u201d says Potter, who has worked at the Upward Sun River site since 2006 and was the one who discovered the children in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a lack of sites [on Beringia and North America], it\u2019s also the presence of a robust dataset of sites that shows a clear expansion from northeast Asia into the Aldan region, into northeast Siberia, and then finally into Beringia at around 14,500.\u201d\n\nBut how can two such different scientific interpretations coexist side by side? Welcome to the real struggle with the story of human history: the question of whose facts come first, those of archaeologists or those of geneticists. As Potter puts it, genetics provides information about the populations and their splits, while archaeology points to the physical location of these populations and how they interacted with their environment.\n\nToday, scientists find themselves having to incorporate these two strands of information in ways that don't always seem to agree.\n\n\u201cWe should remember that the earliest proven trace of human activity in eastern Beringia dates to around 14.1-thousand-years-ago, making the Upward Sun River site nearly 3,000 years too young to be representative of the initial human colonization of the New World,\u201d said archaeologist Brian T. Wygal of Adelphi University by email. \u201cBased solely on the archaeological data, human variability in the late Pleistocene was already quite diverse by the time of the Upward Sun River child burials.\u201d\n\nGeneticist and archaeologist Dennis O\u2019Rourke of the University of Kansas, whose lab sequenced the mitochondrial DNA of the Upward Sun River infants several years ago but wasn\u2019t involved in this study, agrees that there are some growing pains in the field now that archaeology and genetics are becoming more mixed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a continuing challenge to figure out how to integrate these different types of data and ways of approaching the past,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says. \u201cQuestions can be raised [with this paper] where the archaeological and the genetic data might point to different geographic populations, but I think those will ultimately be resolved with more archaeological and genomic data from different geographic regions.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time such questions have been raised. As East Asian historian Nicola Di Cosma writes for the Institute of Advanced Study, \u201cThe tendency to explain the distribution of genes according to assumed patterns of behavior of certain peoples and societies is quite common in ancient DNA studies. Ultimately, these assumptions go back to historical, anthropological, and archaeological models, and sometimes not the best of them.\u201d\n\nThat leads to the other issue with this new research: it relies on a single sample. \u201cWe could know something about the extent of diversity in this early Beringian population with greater certainty if we had multiple genomes,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says.\n\nDi Cosma is even more blunt. \u201cThe samples from which the ancient DNA information is extracted are miniscule: how relevant are they to population movements across Eurasia over a couple of millennia?\u201d he writes.\n\nBut ancient remains are exceedingly rare, and even when they\u2019re found, using them for science is fraught with ethical complications. Perhaps most well known is the Kennewick Man, a 9,000-year-old man discovered in Washington who ignited a legal battle between scientists and local indigenous groups who wanted to rebury him. Willerslev ultimately used DNA samples to prove the genetic link between the ancient skeleton and modern Native Americans, allowing him to be returned under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n\nPotter and the rest of the team worked hard to avoid any missteps in their analysis of the Upward Sun River children, cooperating with the local tribes before doing any testing and trying to answer questions they might be interested in. Smithsonian.com reached out to the Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of 42 member tribes in Alaska that includes the region where Upward Sun River is located, but didn\u2019t receive a response before publication.\n\nThe team's analysis has already uncovered fascinating insights. For instance, findings from Upward Sun \u201crepresents the first evidence of human use of salmon in the New World,\u201d Potter says. \u201cOne of the elements we can develop through the bones is that we want to look at the mother\u2019s diet and potential changes through time that might let us understand if people were storing salmon over the winter.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the most valuable knowledge from this and future discoveries will likely be some combination of genetics, artifacts and paleo-environmental data, says O\u2019Rourke. Taken all together, the amalgam of sciences could show how humans created material culture to interact with and survive in their environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always reaching a little further in one place than another,\u201d O\u2019Rourke says. \u201cThat\u2019s the challenge\u2014how to integrate these different streams of knowledge.\u201d\n\nEditor's Note, January 5, 2018: This article has been updated to clarify how the new paper presented different models for the origins of the Ancient Beringians."}, {"title": "Changing climate prompts boreal forest shift", "url": "https://phys.org/news/2015-06-climate-prompts-boreal-forest-shift.html", "content": "Sam Demientieff takes a core sample from a mature white spruce tree along the lower Yukon River in 2007.

Their findings were recently published online by the journal Forest Ecology and Management.\n\n'For the first time across a major forest region, we have real data showing that biome shift has started,' Juday said. 'This is not a scenario model, or a might, or a maybe. The boreal forest in Interior Alaska is very near dying from unsuitably warm temperatures.

Juday and Alix gathered white spruce tree cores and disks from 540 trees in 36 stands along the Yukon, Tanana and Kuskokwim rivers. They started in easternmost Alaska and sampled downriver to the western edge of the boreal forest near the Bering Sea. The research required the team to travel hundreds of miles down some of the most pristine large rivers left on Earth. Sam Demientieff, a longtime Interior river traveler and Alaska Native leader, provided much of the river transportation and expertise required to navigate the silt-filled water and constantly shifting channels.\n\nFloodplain white spruce stand along lower Yukon River, late at night near the summer solstice in 2007.

They then compared that growth to temperature data from eastern, Interior and Western Alaska historical records and weather stations. In addition, they drew on previous scientists' work chronicling tree growth and temperature back more than two centuries.\n\nThey found that in Interior Alaska, as summer temperatures rose, the growth of the trees slowed. Meanwhile, in Western Alaska, which is also warming, the trees are growing more rapidly.\n\nWhite spruce trees thrive within an optimal temperature range. The long-term average temperature in Interior Alaska used to be at the high end of that optimum. In Western Alaska, the average temperature was below or at the low end of the optimal temperature range.\n\nA stand of white spruce across the Tanana River at Caribou Crossing Research Natural Area in 2008.

Interior Alaska's average temperature became warmer than the trees' ideal range, and growth slowed. Meanwhile, the average temperature in Western Alaska increased to more closely match optimal conditions, which increased growth.\n\n'One aspect of the study that makes the results especially clear is that the trees were all growing in the same environment along the big rivers,' Juday said. 'In many transect studies, lots of variables change across the area studied. In ours, the main thing that changed was the climate, from the hot, dry summers of the Interior, to the cooler, wetter climate near the coast.'\n\nJuday notes that their findings don't mean the boreal forest is going away. It's simply shifting away from lowlands in Interior Alaska to higher elevations and the western part of the state, he said.

Nearly all of this new material consists of unconsolidated pyroclastic fall and flow (surge) deposits that are highly susceptible to wave erosion and thus additional changes in the configuration of the island are likely.

The latest eruption began at 01:41 UTC on February 4 (16:41, February 3 AKST) produced a small volcanic ash plume that was observed on satellite and moved towards the north over the Bering Sea at an altitude of less than 25,000 ft above sea level.This makes the list of recent significant explosive phases at the volcano during the past 2 weeks to be 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 31 Jan, 3 and 4 Feb. The Aviation Color Code has been swinging between RED and ORANGE in tandem with the explosive activity.Depending on wind direction, the larger eruptions have been causing light to moderate ash falls in the city of Unalaska 98 km to the southeast from Bogoslof.As local result of the repeated explosions, the small island's morphology is quickly changing: the vast bay enclosing the vent area, photographed on January 10, is now closed and contains a lake. A second, smaller lake is located in another crater just east of the first one. With the isolation of the crater from sea water access, the explosivity of the eruptions should gradually decline as less water reaches the erupting magma.

The same lava flow subsequently wrapped around Kapoho cinder cone and entered it through the gap on its east side, filling up the crater and creating a large steam plume as it evaporated all the water of Green Lake. As lava continues to pour into the Kapoho cinder cone in Green forest, it creates a stunning \u2018lava fall\u2019The active flow then spread out to a 0.5 mile wide lava flow front that continues to make its way towards the ocean at Kapoho Bay. On Sunday evening 3 June 19h00 local time HVO/USGS reported that this flow front was merely 225 meter (245 yards) away from the ocean.The lava fountaining from fissure 8 in the western part of the eruptive system was the main activity over the past few days. Whereas fissures 18 and 22 were still feeding lava flows traveling south by the end of last week, both were inactive by the early morning of Saturday 2 June when the only other active flow noted during an overflight was from fissure 16, in the eastern part of the active rift system, which was weakly active. By Sunday 3 June local time none of the fissures besides fissure 8 were active as by then fissure(s) 16 (and 18) only showed incandescence without fountaining. At the same time heavy steaming and abundant gas emission was noted from fissure(s) 9 (and 10), potentially announcing re-activation of these vents which prompted mandatory evacuation for the Leilani Estates area around these fissures.Meanwhile atthe vent inside Halema\u2019uma\u2019u crater keeps collapsing as magma was drained from beneath it and the summit area is deflating. A small explosion occurred on Friday afternoon 13h39 but ash emissions have overall decreased, possibly reflecting the accumulation of rubble at the base of the growing summit crater. Earthquake activity was low during the night from Friday 1 June to Saturday 2 June but then seismicity picked up again and there were many earthquakes overnight from Saturday 2 to Sundqay 3 June, leading the HVO/USGS to expect a another small explosion to take place in the next day. Whereas ash emissions from Halema\u2019uma\u2019u crater are currently low, the emission of volcanic gasses remains high.Volcanic Ash Advisory Center Washington (VAAC) issued the following report: NEW ERUPTION ARND 04/0151Z : Volcanic Ash Advisory Center Washington (VAAC) issued the following report: NEW VA EM ARND 0640Z A strong eruptive phase (paroxysm) occurred at the volcano yesterday (Sun 3 June). Lasting for about 16-17 hours until the evening, it generated ash clouds reaching up to 10 km, which drifted into westerly directions for more than 40 km, lava flows descending on the flanks, heavy ash fall in nearby areas and secondary mud flows triggered by strong rainfall.Sadly, massive pyroclastic flows - fast-moving turbulent avalanches of gas and hot rock material - have claimed lives as well. Precise numbers are so far unclear, but may be in the range of dozens if not more, depending on varying local sources and estimates. From official side, at least 7 victims have been confirmed. All fatalities occurred as result of being engulfed in pyroclastic surges, it seems mainly on the eastern flank.: Volcanic Ash Advisory Center Buenos Aires (VAAC) issued the following report: UNABLE TO DETECT OBS VA DTG:04/1315Z"}]}, {"actual_city": "Visokoi Island, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands", "occurence_timestamp": 1546473788150, "occurence_date": "03 Jan 2019", "magnitude": 5.1, "news": [{"title": "Earthquake info : M5.2 earthquake on Wed, 3 Oct 23:59:42 UTC / - 60km N of Visokoi Island, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands - 5 experience reports", "url": "https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/2148567/M5-Wed-3-Oct--60km-N-of-Visokoi-Island-South-Georgia-and-the-South-Sandwich-Islands.html", "content": ": The Hawaiian Islands are not only home to the most active volcanoes in the world, Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the Big Island, but also boast a unique natural environment.
